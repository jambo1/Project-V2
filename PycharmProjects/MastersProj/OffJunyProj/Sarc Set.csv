I can't believe you would be so insensitive to his distress, smh.","TIFU by pretending to be a mannequin Like so many others this didn't happen yesterday, but a few years ago when I was in college. I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear. All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat. Not a single piece of skin was showing. I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window. This is where the FU happens. I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange. For the most part people aren't noticing me. Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right. That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger. He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working. A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms. The older fellow was black too. He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist. He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people. TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin. Scared a little kid who happened to be black. Got called a racist."

1,But separating and demonizing people different then you has had such positive benefits in the past.,"This summer I went to an Asian festival. There were people there from all different Asian cultures sharing food, info, etc. There was a tent set up with a table for each Asian culture to share history and info to visitors. I went to support a friend who was competing in the dragon boat race but enjoyed the food and stuff as well. I do hoop dance so I brought my hoop with me and a bunch of old Asian men and women commented that they lived my Totoro rights, and the guys running that culture/info tent made me dance and share my dancing with them. It was great fun and I can't wait to go again next year. I posted about it on fb to a hooping group and got shit on about how I dont belong there and I was appropriating their culture and that the festival was made for people of color, not whites. So it's okay for Spanish and black people to go to learn, but not whites. Fuck that girl. I had a custard bun and faced to kpop. When I mention that I was excited that I heard music being played from Korea that I knew and loved (I love kpop, fight me), the girl on fb lost her shit. People like that drive me crazy. White people get so upset while the people actually a part of these cultures want nothing more than to share with us. :'("

The officer implied that it was basically my fault for not having a fence. I didn't think that was a fair assessment of the situation, and I still disagree with her.

Archer tower already sent an arrow, and cannon thinks ""Mmm, MP is going to die from this arrow, (and i am so lazy), i wouldn't shoot"". Arrow velocity is pretty slow, and when it comes to target, MP already cut down that cannon. And during the arrow's flight there was enough time for cannon to shoot and kill that damn MP.

At the time, I was around 25 and he was almost 30. It was his first 'real job' out of college. He apparently grew up in a very sheltered, religious household. His dad is apparently a very high-ranking official in the UN. And due to an unfortunate strings of circumstances, Kevin sat next to me: * Kevin had zero computer skills. As a new employee, the company will issue you the standard computer, 8GB flash drive, along with employee handbook, etc. etc. He refused the flash drive because the size was too small (physically) and he believed it won't have any storage capacity. * So he kept having to borrow my flash drive. He also didn't know how to plug it into his computer and kept complaining that the flash drive is ""broken"". * We're an international company with offices in many countries. So, it goes without saying that we all communicate through email. He drafts EVERY EMAIL (even simple replies) on PAPER and then asks me to proof read it before he sends it out. He works as a COPYWRITER. * He asked me if the ""SEND"" button in Outlook means that his email was sent out. * He has more than once got scammed by those Nigerian Prince emails. He sends them his password when they ask for it. * He likes to google my full name (it's not a common name at all. Only I have it.). He googles it often enough that it pops up every time he types in the first letter of my name on Google. One day, he got so excited and showed it to me because I was ""FAMOUS"" because Google knows my name. * Each month, the housekeeper would walk around and issue out tissue paper to put at our workstation. The first time, he asked me what it was. * He drives the cleaning ladies insane by going into the pantry, use plates and mugs and put them back in the cupboard without washing them. When confronted, his argument was that he'll use it again eventually. * He likes to listen in on conversations. More than once, he would ask me what people in five workstations away were talking about. * He stares at people. ALL. THE. TIME. And stare at your computer screen and comment on what you're working on. * He didn't know how to put staples in staplers. When I helped him with it, his reply: ""Thank you so much. I'm just not used to these new technologies."" * He constantly asks people how much their salary is. * His probation period was extended (understandably. he was still asking me to proofread his emails). When HR told him, he threw a tantrum claiming that they can't do that because he already told his mom that he passed the probation. * He often takes his copywriting work home for his mom to check. This is what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm know there's more as he drove me nuts to the point that I wanted to quit and the Head of HR had to console me. I was his designated babysitter for the duration of his time there. People still joke that one day he might come into the office and shoot everyone. I would be the first to go."

1,I could before,"I can't tell whether OP is just shitposting, but I'll jump in here to have a real conversation with y'all about this. The current design of the client would have to change pretty dramatically to make this change because there's nothing behind the friends list in the updated client. If you minimized it, we'd have to dynamically stretch everything to fill the space. Remember, we've redesigned just about every page in the updated client to work using the current layout. And it's designed to fit comfortably at the current aspect ratio with the friends list basically sitting to the side of it. To get super real with y'all, we've had a few people saying this whenever they get access to the alpha, but we think it's mostly just because it's a change from the legacy client, and we're expecting it to die down on its own. No one has really brought up an interesting reason for redesigning everything just so you could minimize it as before. It's only really been ""I could before."" But I'm all ears if there's a real case for it!"

I'm still basking in the glory of it, actually. I decided to eat at this hot dog place near work for lunch, and when I approached the register I noticed two employees chatting at the end of the counter. They're both teenagers, one awkward dude and a pretty, attractive girl. I stand there waiting and the guy looks over, sees me, and then turns to continue talking to the girl. I am not really the kind of person to say ""excuse me!"" so I just stood there. I was waiting long enough to get my phone out and text my friend about the situation. So dude's really working it, trying to be funny. All the while she's occupying herself with some task and laughing politely. Dude is laughing hard at his own jokes and straight up ignoring me. Finally the girl sees me and nods in my direction, telling dude to go do his job. When he walks up, I am really pissed off. I'm not really in the business of confronting strangers, but this one bothered me more than usual. So I say loudly, ""hey, glad you could take a break from trying to bang your coworker to take my order."" At this, dude looks quickly to the girl and she visibly recoils and says, ""ugh, what?"" Dude tries to recover, saying he didn't notice me standing there, but the damage had been done. He looked defeated, girl looked extremely uncomfortable, and now I'm eating in the corner watching them actively ignore each other and pretend the other doesn't exist. Enjoy the rest of your shift, awkward teenage boy. Also, sorry about the collateral damage, teenage girl."

For the minimum usable, I'd say Snapdragon S4 Pro, aka the Nexus 7 2013. This is noticeably slower with some lag, but not enough to really slow you down. Loading up more intense websites can be a pain. Feels like a budget device. So, what are your thoughts on this?"

As frustrating as it is with conspiracy theorists (I mean I use that term even loosely because, as you mentioned, the extent of research these people do is a bunch of YouTube videos and Anonymous's Facebook feed nonsense) calling everyone who doesn't believe this trash ""sheeple"" and demanding that we ""wake up!"" and ""do research"" is equally as annoying as people who sit on the other side and attack them, saying that they're wearing ""tin foil hats"", that they are ""crazy"" and ""uninformed"". Honestly just let people form their own ideas even if they seem ridiculous. Their crazy ideas aren't hurting you. It seems that with social media everybody is quick to calling each other a *somethingist* and tell others how wrong they are. So what if they're wrong? and so what if someone doesn't believe what you do? It's exhausting, tiresome and pointless to try and convince a stranger on the internet to switch to your side, and it never happens. Basically I just hate both types of people with regards to this."

1,But but but then sniper riffles would be actually good at something and no no no snipers are not allowed to be so.,"Armor really needs a complete rework (alongside many other things...) to be something more than just a multiplicative damage modifier. I've always personally been a fan of armor acting as a damage subtraction modifier instead (essentially making high armor targets impervious to high rate of fire low damage weapons), since it at least is different, whereas the current system could be entirely eliminated in favor of just more base health. Then you can have armor *penetration*, which reduces how effective armor is at subtracting your damage, and a flat health type modifier which multiplies your damage according to its type. If you want a more involved system, just make armor its own health bar like shields, and make certain damage types reduce it over time. Damage type modifiers would affect armor health and enemy health separately, so you don't deal +1000% damage because the enemy has 1 armor point left."

Had he been a true progressive, he would have accepted Jill's invitation to join forces with her and run on a truly progressive platform - that could have won a plurality of votes. And now he wants to ""save"" the Party that denied him the nomination and that now is in a shambles. What a waste. We need to build a new progressive movement outside the duopoly and be wary of ""leaders"" who can be so easily co-opted as Sanders was.

Also, these idolatarian Christian Goys with reddish faces and hairs are the descendants of Edom(=red), and our Rabbi says that they're kind of like animals, barely human, and just like the wild animals don't like to have masters, these goys alike don't like to have masters!

If they have no objections, then I will now appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court."" Garland goes and tries to hear court cases an act as a Supreme Court Justice from then on out. What would be the reaction? Immediately obvious would be *substantial* push back by Republicans in the Senate, and such a disagreement would likely lead to the nuclear option and an end to Democratic filibusters. But that might happen regardless of Obama's actions. Would the other Supreme Court justices accept Garland, or refuse him? What happens when Trump comes to power and tries to replace him? Do the other Supreme Court justices accept this, or try to limit this action? If he does succeed in replacing Garland, does this have any potential to have him try and remove other justices for disagreements with him and would those efforts work?"

Dave is obsessed over Robyn, the ""girl next door"", he constantly hits on her even though she has a BF, keeps old photos of when they were kids, and finds any excuse to be around her. Throughout the whole movie Robyn never gives any inclination that she sees Dave as more than just a friend even turning down his ""one phone call"" from jail prom proposal. She is nice to him throughout the whole movie, but it is obvious she is not romantically interested in him. However at the end of the movie when Dave sticks up for Link and defends him being a cave man something is supposed to magically change in Robyn where she loses interest in the free spirit Link, and becomes interested in Dave. Even allowing Dave to kiss her at his pool party. The whole movie is unrealistic to an insane degree, but its a fun little adventure. And for some reason Robyn's change of heart is more unbelievable than find a caveman and his counterpart stuck in ice and thawing them out. It's the classic Happy Hollywood Ending. Robyn should have stayed as a friend to Dave, and the ending could have been his self realization that what other think about him, is far less important on how he perceives himself."

1,Blizzard should also add a trading system so we can trade skins and things like that.,"OverWatch ""LoadOuts"": Is overwatch combat diverse enough? I've had this thought in my mind for a long time now, about how overwatches combat design is very simple. We get to choose a hero, the hero has a kit and you go kill some dudes. It's a good formula, and it works. My idea takes the original idea and builds upon it, Keep in mind these ideas I am presenting don't necessarily have to or will ever have an impact on the current state of the game. That being said I want overwatch to introduce ""Loadouts"". Loadouts would work similar to how the league of legends rune system would work where people could choose how to improve their gameplay through through additional increases in stats or even passive abilities, this would introduce strategic diversity among the champion pools. This would give players more to think of when playing this competitive mode. Example: a loadout could include an increase to the shield power of winston's shield (E) along with more damage with a trade off for less HP and mobility. Perhaps. This is just a basic/rough concept of how it would work, please tell me how it would be broken or otherwise. My other idea was something that came to me when they announced sym getting two different ultimate abilities. My idea takes that further and allows each hero to have two different kits. This gives players more options for their play styles and changes the dynamic of the game. This idea would most likely take up a lot of resources and less likely to happen. And lastly these changes would happen on a different game mode, so as to not effect the original style."

Now, of course, Soldier might not work because of the enemy comp, and if they'd said that, fair, but they told him to switch so *someone else* could play Soldier and do it better. And the entire team jumped on that. Not because they needed another hero instead of Soldier, but because they had somehow gotten it into their heads that the only reason they were losing was because of the gold Soldier being bad at Soldier.

1,Yeah and I'm sure the tens of thousands of innocent Japanese Christians had it coming too.,"The Real History is the Japanese didn't ""buy-in"" to voluntary extortion white religious imprisonment. Throwing out the white European 'christians' is what lead Japan to close its ports for over 200 years. The Japanese saw the Holy Roman Church was using Jesuits as their exploratory invasion force, with their ""We Come In Peace"" routine. In Nagasaki, there is the site where a barrel the size of a large swimming pool was filled with boiling oil and 38 priests were thrown into that. Scorsese actually gets a lot of reality mixed in with his movies. Several scenes are real scenes in real life, like the scene in Casino where Nicky and his brother dig their own graves in a Kansas corn field, stripped to their underwear and beaten with baseball bats until they were *almost* dead, then thrown into the grave and buried alive. There are news photos from the discovery of their bodies, and Scorcese had the scene laid out just like it happened. He is showing the extremely close relationship of the Mafia with the Pope in his Godfather movies. He seems to be sending the message about how evil the Holy Roman Church has been, so it will be interesting to see how he portrays this pivotal period."

From what I understand, the quality of boot camp programs can vary a lot, even within the same organization. I'm super happy with mine. I think my campus has something like a ~90% placement rate for graduates, and it's in a growing tech area (Indianapolis). In researching their curriculum, I found some reviews that almost scared me off, but I went to a Meetup they hosted and a few other events, talked to alumni, saw how plugged in they are with the local tech community, and I was sold. I heard from multiple people that it's the best decision they've made for their careers. I'm not finished with the program, but so far, I'm inclined to agree. Do some local research if you're considering options. Don't trust Google'd reviews unless it's relevant to your local campus. Scope out the relationships and connections with area tech employers. Talk to alumni, especially; they'll know better than anyone if it's ""worth it"". tl;dr - Maybe."

1,Don't worry they'll get people to repair people's because there's so going to be demand for 100000s of repair people in a given area !,"That's a false conclusion. Two examples that are more local are: the self checkout at many major department stores. One person watching over 6-12 self checkout lanes is not making 6-12 times what one register clerk makes. So even with the labor pricing staying the same there is still phasing out of employees. Another is Walmart laying off 91 people in their optical labs. White collar jobs that require at least some modicum of being above the lowest common denominator are still at risk. The final and less local example is Foxconn. You may remember this company for making the news due to work related stress induced suicide attempts. They just announced 60,000 layoffs. It's a Chinese company and organizations have been outsourcing to China for slave labor wages for decades. Line all of those up. You can't get paid the same always, or you face replacement. You can't be paid above the average because it is work related replacement due to automation. You can't even be slaved to mental collapse. If a job can somehow be replaced by automation, it will. Employee payment has literally nothing to do with it. Lights out factories exist. One or two rooms in a facility where humans regularly occupy the space, the rest of the rooms can be completely dark with no hiccups. Bill gates says society isn't ready for the amount of job loss automation will spur on. This finger pointing to people who deserve a fair and living wage is proof of it"

The military doesn't let the flag touch the ground. What a fucking slap in the face to see people burning it in the streets because they don't like someone elected to a cabinet position. In Donald's words: Sad!

My goal is to make $5k to pay for my wedding coming up next year. My only rule is that every bet has to be all-in. I've avoided parlays (although I did take Pats and Raiders to win in a parlay yesterday afternoon) I also have taken bets I normally wouldn't take like Golden State to win betting $200 to win $20 or something silly like that. Anyone try this strategy? How did it work out? Anything I should look out for? My betting units are usually in the single digits, so these last few bets have been pretty fun to watch unfold! I figure I'm 4-5 bets away from hitting my goal. It feels a bit like real-life Who Wants To Be A Millionaire... this is me using a lifeline to call Reddit and get some pointers."

If a developer wants to invest and recoup their investment that is one thing, but tens of millions of public money for a private hotel that will never generate the ROI for the city is disgraceful. Of course, if there is some evidence that the revenue being brought into VB over the next 5 years fully offsets or exceeds the millions in tax breaks and incentives, I withdraw my negative opinion."

1,Spoken like a true Tumblrina,"Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to eat 800 big Macs, but take it from this old McDonald's rat, I've spent my entire adult life eating at McDonnald's, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. If you only eat big Macs one part of your body (and that's all a single burger type like Big Mac is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. Big Macs basically only train the gut muscles and to some extent, the esophagus. What you really want to do is train your entire digestive system, all the major gut groups (esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, and kidneys) at the same time, over the course of a Big Mac meal. So, you will need to add large Big fries, and Large coke with it. Ask for the ""Go Big"" program. I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three big meals! Falling in love with eating big Macs, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find any McDonnald near you, with qualified burger flippers who will design your burger for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fatness. Three to 5 burgers a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being out of shape the first time you walk into McDonnalds. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway. Now get out there and get fat! :-)"

1,Obviously you can't survive a scooping because the scooper hits you right in the nutsack at high speeds,"Why Does Everyone Keep Saying That a Person Can't Survive Scooping? Every time the topic of scooping, the identity of Eggs, or the ending to the game is brought up, people immediately start reciting, ""You can't survive scooping!"" But why does everyone assume so? In truth, we don't actually know what happens when a human gets scooped. Nowhere in the game is it clarified, so don't go trying to pass speculation as fact. In reality, the only piece of evidence we have is that Ennard tells the player that, ""You won't die."" (side note: the final cutscene monologue's meaning is still up for debate, so whether or not it turns out that Michael believes the scooping should have killed him is unknown) Whether or not Ennard is a trustworthy source is arguable, but the possibility that scooping a human really doesn't kill them can't just be outright dismissed. Indeed, the only human we're aware of to be scooped, Eggs, survives. There might be some piece of actual evidence I'm forgetting, but it seems right now that a few people started saying that no one can survive scooping in order to make the events of the game agree with their headcanons, and now that there's evidence to the contrary, there are still a ton of people who still treat this speculation (albeit, reasonable speculation) as fact."

Have you guys ever felt like the characters and the world of Paladins has too much of their own personalities and, most of the time, they don't seem to mix well togheter? When I first heard the name ""Paladins"", what I had in my was this medieval world where people battle using knights, magic and whatnot, but the game is set on a totally different reality. You have people using high technology powered by magical crystals, then you have people that haven't decided what they want to be... Have you guys taken a look at Skye? Like... she's an ELF, that uses technology to be hidden and pretend to be a JAPANESE NINJA? What about Grohk? He's an OGRE but, at the same time, a NATIVE AMERICAN? It feels like Grohk heard about World of Warcraft and went too literal on the Shaman look. He's blue, he's a native american and he uses a staff powered by crystals. Fernando, Bomb King, Cassie, Barik and Drogoz seem to be from the same ""Medieval Characters with magical hi-tech weapons"" pack, but at some point in development, they forgot about it and said ""Fuck it, we will have japanese elves, russian soldiers and that tree from the other game. - Oh shit, he doesn't have a weapon? Er... give him... an axe? You throw them, but he gets another one out of somewhere. Not to mention the characters are homeless. Why are the some many inca temples in the game? Why does Androxus is trying to destroy Buzz Lighthyear? Why does Sha Lin's bow deal more damage than Kinessa's fucking sniper rifle? Is it because he's asian? I think characters and the world itself has too much of their own and they hardly share characteristic with each other. If you look at TF2, they are all soldiers, fighting. On Street Fighters, they are all martial artists, humanoids and differentiate themselves by their nationality and culture. Paladins is a fat kid with a Naruto bandana on it's head and earphones pumping country songs."

Half of my wife's siblings have left. I know of other family and friends who have serious questions. Is there a trend in the church of people questioning and leaving? If so, how is the church addressing this? RENLUND: We have always seen people come into the church and people leave the church. We are not seeing an increase in people leaving. My SIL was very disappointed to hear this assessment after what he has seen in the family. And hearing of the many people I have seen leave.

I think this is a fair option given how low drop rates are on top of the RNG of stats roll. This comes out to 1 cache per 25 Lex Challenging runs (not counting the phoenix coins you can earn from selling the loot and buying basic sealed cache). There are quite a few named weapon/gear out there so there is still a layer of RNG plus the usual stats roll RNG. I understand the point of making the item rare and the ""rewarding"" feeling a player gets when one drops, but the current system is just a painful grind. I know players who have ran lex over 300 times with no Barret Drop or a drop that is absolutely horrible. This scenario is also true for other players who are grinding the other missions for named items. yes i know you can be viable without Barrett.. i've been running reckless + skulls for a while now and I do very well in the DZ. However it is very frustrating to log in and see 90% of your friends running lex and the other 10% just being salty after running lex."

Also, adding another generic badass normal character kind of takes away Victor Awesomes of being able to go toe to toe with Witches, Dragons and God Slayers with just an assault riffle and some grenades. So, Hi Rez, learn your lesson, stop releasing generic base female characters with generic kits and instead start releasing more animal-based characters, and you'll basically hit the jackpot."

Bolt is a full tenth faster than everyone else (9.58 WR in the 100 meters, to 9.69 at #2 by Tyson Gay), which is probably unprecedented. But Justin Gatlin won gold in 2004 with a time of 9.85. Tyson Gay and others have broken into the 9.7s and 9.6s since. Who knows what the standards will be in 20 years. Swimming records keep falling too. Katie Ledecky just destroyed a ton of her own world records, winning 4 golds and a silver at age 19 in Rio. Phelps had the greatest career of any Olympian by far. But Mark Spitz, Missy Franklin, Ledecky, and others have shown that winning 5ish golds in one Olympics isn't a unique thing that only Phelps could do. I could maybe see some future swimmer surpassing Phelps, as he surpassed Spitz's 7/7 golds (tho Spitz set a WR in each of the 7 too)."

1,You lost me at alliance.,"Looking for people on U.S. (Alliance) to play with. Hey all, So WoW has gotten a bit stale for me even though I love the game. Been playing since Vanilla and I love the game in and out. However a lot of my friends have moved on and I've found myself not communicating with anyone anymore. I love going on but I find that within an hour or so, I just get bored and sign off because I really have no one to talk to. Guilds don't really feel like a community either, so I just feel sort of isolated. I am just looking for some people to chill with in game and do things. I'm between Regular Mythics and M+, but can never find groups. I don't really PvP due to my crushing lack of friends in game. This may just sound like me crying on the internet, but I really want to get onto WoW and have people to talk to/do things with. If you want to add me to BNet my BattleTag is Shakencakes#1636 (I am also on the Buddy List). My alliance characters are on Emerald Dream and my Horde is on KJ. I just felt like I needed to do something to put myself out there and try to make some WoW friends again. Thanks for listening and have a great holiday! =)"

1,Your story makes me feel so safe.,"I'd like to share my hilarious/painful YYC airport security experience from today So today, my wife, 4 year old son and 7 month old daughter left for Winnipeg for Christmas (no, going to Winnipeg wasn't the painful part). Anyway, I decided to help out and got one of those accompanying passes to help my wife get to the gate with the kids. We get through the metal detectors, and first off, my wife and baby get randomly selected for swabbing. That was fine but they also wanted to do a thorough check of one of our bins with a carry-on case, my shoes, phone and wallet. Anyway, before they can do our bag, they were taking, I kid you not, twenty minutes to frisk every crevice of a lady in a wheelchair so while waiting I told my wife to just go ahead and take the kids to so she could feed the baby and get food for my son. Finally, they get to our bag, rifle through it and find my wife's breast pump. The security lady swabs it and puts the sample in the machine, and the alarm goes off. I'm told there is an ""inconclusive"" organic substance on my ""child monitor"". I clarify that it's a breast pump so it might be breast milk. Doesn't matter, they need to see my baby. Yep, that's right, they need my baby right away. So I ask for my shoes but the lady says I can't have them. Then they call over a security escort to escort me to find my ""high security risk"" baby and he sees in my socks and says ""you need your shoes on sir"". I reply that they won't give them to me at security. So they conduct a ""pat down"" of my shoes and give them to me. So we are looking for my family and the escort is all impatient and asks ""Can't you just contact them somehow?"" to which I ask ""With what? My phone you won't let me have?"" and he shuts up. We find my family, bring them back and we are explained that because of the inconclusive swab, they have to pat down and swab THE BABY and ONE parent of our choice. Uuuuuh, what? Now remember, they already swabbed the baby and my wife once. I mean it's great that only two of us need to be pat down, but how does that make any sense whatsoever?! So ya, half our family had to be pat down, but one had to be the 7 month old baby. I mean, as much as it would have been annoying, would it not make sense that our whole family had to be pat down? Were they worried our baby was a drug mule or something? And if they were worried, why was patting me down, when I'm not even going on the flight, a viable option? And my son, with his beady little eyes, how come he didn't raise any suspicion at all?! And if none of this makes any sense, why is this even a procedure at all?! Anyway, lesson learned. Never EVER bring a breast pump on carry-on. We only had it in there because our check in case was a tad over the weight limit."

1,How about just reduce her base AD by 5.,"Camille deserves nerfs - but lets do it right I've spammed the ever loving hell out of camille lately and have just recently hit mastery 7 on her, and I can confirm that she is busted. However I feel like what riot generally ends up doing is just nerfing the base stats or damage of a champ like her until she is effectively gutted. There are less drastic ways to nerf her that will still keep her as a viable pick, but not as oppressive. The main thing with her that makes her hilariously busted in my opinion is her ability to trade for free in lane with little to no counterplay for most opposing toplaners. Unless you are playing jax, poppy, or fiora, camille's lane is almost as abusive as renektons with her also scaling better into the game. The main issue is the q2 prep e-aa-q combo, which can deal an upwards of a third of someones health with absolutely no way to deal with it. So what are the best ways to nerf her? -Increased e cooldown in the early levels by a lot, I feel like a ~20 second cd will keep her ability to trade for free down -Remove attack speed buff on e, its a completely unnecessary stat boost and I'm not quite sure why its there -Make her shield health percentage scale by level, starting at 10% and increasing to 20% These nerfs will serve to bring her back in line without going too far, if she still needs nerfs after that she can get looked at again"

I realize the US TV market doesn't get much/anything from televising Raptors games but don't the viewers want to watch fun games and not Minnesota. They had one christmas game in history and that was in 2001, so how come they don't get another one because they are exciting to watch and are on a pace for the best offense in history and best bench unit in the NBA currently.

Ovechkin has more 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20 goal seasons than Crosby. * Ovechkin has beat Crosby more times in hart voting (06, 08, 09, 10, 11, 13, 15) and in scoring (06, 08, 09, 11, 12) compared to Crosby (07, 14, 15, 16) * More career goals and points * Ovechkin and hit 50 goals and 100 points in the same season 4 times, Crosby has done it once. * Ovechkin has been a Ted Lindsay finalist 6 times, only 4 times for Crosby * Ovechkin has won 3 consecutive Ted Lindsay's and 4 consecutive Richards, feats Crosby has never done. * More all star team selections. Ovechkin has 11 to Crosby's 6. * Ovechkin has a case of being the greatest LW in history. Crosby has no case of being the best center in history * Ovechkin has a case of being the greatest goal score in history. Crosby has no case of beng the best in a category (playmaking, goal scoring, hockey IQ etc.) * Ovechkin won all of his trohpies fairly. Crosby won his Conn Smythe based on reputation. * Ovechkin has no help in the playoffs. Crosby can thank Malkin and Kessel for his rings. * Ovechkin has appeared in more all star games. * Put Ovechkin on Team Canada and Crosby on Team Russia and the results are the same."

1,Why would I want wards when I can double kill bot lane as support Lux,"What if upgrading sightstone opens up a special slot for control ward Sometimes when i play support and the games drag out to a long period of time, both teams have max items except for the support, who has to empty out a slot for the control ward, and usually gets smashed by enemy adc due to lack of an extra tank item. Some may argue not getting an control ward solves the problem easily, but for a support wards are their only pride they leave on the map as dominance. Which is why i thought, why not giving a sightstone upgrade that grants the player an extra slot **ONLY** for control ward. Or better, a *refillable* control ward. (Might prove^too^overpowered?) I feel that this gives the sightstone a sense of uniqueness with the addition of an upgrade, since sightstone=refillable wards; and sightstone+ = control ward slot (or refillable control wards). Just my thoughts on making a support life easier, helping to get rid of the frustration of a support to keep a empty slot when everyone is full items, and you're just gonna get chunked out while peeling for your adc.

What where they thinking when owerpowering so many average players permanently???? It would been ok during MLS playoffs/finals but then they should have been back to normal average level.

1,"Nope, record is all that matters, Sun belt is clearly the best!","Why is ""Overall Bowl Record"" considered a useful metric for determining the comparative strength of conferences? Aren't the bowl games chosen to be fairly even? I think the title is pretty self explanatory. it seems that total wins and losses in bowl games is given a lot of importance when it comes to comparing the strength of conferences, when to me it seems pretty arbitrary. Part of the criteria for selecting bowl games is that they will be fairly even, and interesting to watch, right? If Penn State loses to USC, that will count against the bowl game record for the Big 10, yet if Penn State had played worse in the regular season and then beaten an easy bowl opponent, that would somehow count *for* the Big 10 being strong? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I guess I can see how it's some sort of metric of ""overratedness"". I.e. if you are assigned an opponent you were considered to be roughly equal to, and then get blown out, then maybe you weren't as good as we thought. But a measure of how ""overrated"" teams are is not directly related to how strong they are. A conference could be assigned a bunch of weak bowl opponents, beat them, and that might not necessarily mean they were any better than a conference that went even with tougher bowl opponents."

I feel as if the company could easily have benefited from the established handheld branding, and at the same time, why isn't the Switch backwardly compatible to the 3DS - especially if it uses the same ARM architecture?"

1,yep just like pc gaming,"Is Airsoft Dying? So this is a topic that isn't really covered to much but I feel it needs to really be addressed. I've seen a bit of people on YouTube and other social media platforms talking about it so here is my take of it. Atleast for me at my local field it seems like there is less and less players coming. That itself doesn't mean to much because it's just one field but after talking to my friends, even some from out of my state, most if not all said that their local fields are also not getting as many players as the used to get. Does this mean Airsoft is dying? No not at all it just means that it is expanding faster than the current player base can handle. Back in 2012 there was a huge spike of new Airsoft players and a bunch of new fields and Airsoft retailers and manufacturers opened up. Fast forward 4 years and it has leveled back out to its normal rate of players. All of those manufacturers and fields are now hyper splitting the Airsoft community to give the illusion of less players. That is also the reason why we saw a lot of Airsoft manufacturers go out of business because they expected that huge spike to keep going but it leveled out instead of rising more. Airsoft as a whole isn't dying it is just being hyper split across more and more fields. In a few years a bit of fields will go out of business due to the hyper split player base but that will bring larger numbers back into the other fields and the whole spike in player base and hyper splitting will start all over again."

1,Fucking normies,"What puzzles me about r/incels They will make it very clear that they don't like social-justice types. Plenty of people there mock the idea of ""male privilege"" and other basic concepts of the modern left. Yet when you ask them why ""normies"" don't understand them, the usual response goes along the lines of: average men don't repel women, women don't want to admit to themselves they do this, and incels are by definition lonely and disconnected, so they don't show up on mainstream society's view of itself. In short, they are using the theory behind privilege and invisible minorities, that they claim is without merit. I've been asking myself for a while now: is it worth engaging them? I'm sure I can qualify, and I see among them my own worst traits magnified (passivity, fear of coming across wrong, complete blank at society's web of expectations and simply no interest in what passes for ordinary conversation). The odd thing is, there are still plenty of disturbingly misogynistic posts, but the most upvoted comments are the saner ones, suggesting that the place has a demographic of well-adjusted observers (which is not true of any red-pill sub). There seems to be a pattern of: extremists (Caamib, in this case) found the place, it attracts followers who are less committed, they attract more normal people trying to convert the followers. As it is, I'm unsure I can contribute anything. But I wish I could."

The only relations I have are my two vassals, a 1 province Sarig Yogir, and 5 province Tibet. Together they have like 14k troops, hardly what I would consider ""powerful allies"".

This perk will allow you to store adrenaline past 100%, say up to 125%. As an example as to why this is useful: Currently when in a deaths swiftness it is impossible to do every threshold in your arsenal, however, if you are able to store 125% adrenaline, you can build to 125, ult which uses 90% adren (vigour), adren pot, and immediately have 60% adrenaline while in a deaths swiftness.

Also based on the tone of this subreddit now compared to 2 years ago, what happened? Did a lot of RS3 players come to OSRS and want more or less a version of the live game without Treasure Hunter?

1,Acid rap was an amazing album im sure that had nothing to do with his rise to fame,"Local Chicago artists and rappers I've met believe his dad was instrumental in his rise. Chicago is fucking hard as shit to make it as an artist, partly due to lack of any major label representation. Especially when you're relying on live performances to get noticed. For such a large city, Chicago has a limited number of venues. The city plays a large part in this, mainly through noise restrictions. Even smaller number of venues where rappers can perform. Now because Chance's dad worked for the mayor's office in the past, people suspect he pulled strings that got him the shows he needed to play early on. I have zero evidence of this but after living in Chicago as a performing artist and witnessing first hand how crooked that city is I don't find it hard to believe."

Mining, drilling, excavation, etc. companies want to get the best info to make a profit. If the young earth position was correct, it would be widely taught in schools whose grads would be snapped up by these companies. Instead, they only hire geologists who are taught and do research consistent with an earth that is 4.5 billion years old. Why is it that employment and profitable predictions do not come to young earth geologists at a rate far surpassing the ancient earth geologists? Ask this in a serious, respectful manner (don't be condescending or dismissive.) You want them to think out the answer for themselves."

Workers there come and go but there's an old man that's been there the entire time. Once, a long time ago, he asked me if I would put songs on a mp3 player for him. I told him ~~hell~~ no and that he needed to learn to use a computer himself, to which he didn't like, but I don't care because I can take or leave the guy. The other day I was getting ready to take off and he comes up to me asking me questions (english isn't his first language and like I said, I can take or leave the guy so I just wanted him to go away the entire time) to which I act friendly enough. He starts feeling my arm, saying I must have big muscles, then he starts trying to pull me in for a kiss. I was at work so I couldn't strangle his stupid ass like I would've liked, but I made it clear he's dead to me. This isn't the first time this has happened. Some men just come to the conclusion that I'd have anything to do with them just because I'm polite. And it's not always old men either, guys have beckoned me over for whatever reason and then have leaned in for a kiss *as* I'm telling them I want nothing to do with them. I should just tell them the truth, I'd never consider dating an old man. I think old men are disgusting. They should stick with women their own age. Young women who are into old men have issues or they want their money when they die. Old, broke-ass men that chase after young women are fucking pathetic. No guy, I don't want to get to know you, I don't even want to expend the energy it would take to remember your name. I'd rather go back to before I was burdened with your existence, I miss that, please let me relive that time once again. I swear to all that's holy, I take the time to make myself look as ratchet as possible and I *still* can't get men to leave me alone. I could cover myself with literal feces and will still get hit on by at least one fucking homeless guy. What do I have to do?!? I don't want to assume every man is like that because it's not true. But when I have to look at the ground everywhere I go because merely making eye contact for even one second is enough to get me followed around an entire grocery store (and I see you, motherfucker, you think you're slick but you're as plain as day, do you think I'm stupid or blind?!) what choice do I have but to put up my defenses?

1,But the stats say our defense is top 10,"Living in the past, again, forever into the future I posted this in the offseason, looks like it's playing out perfectly again. Last year I was so hyped, and we all felt the same for good reason. Team had played well before...if Randall and DMC could be ok, and if our defense could be just as good as it was (not very good) then there was no reason to think we wouldn't be a pretty damn good team with a nice shot to do well in the playoffs! I remember posting on here, that NOTHING matters if Romo goes down. Well low and behold, Romo goes down and our team falls apart and we have the worst season in recent memory. Our defense was about as crappy as we felt it would be, our running game was pretty damn good as we hoped it would be. So w hy did we suck so hard? We can't close out teams, and even in 2014, we haven't been able to close out a team with our defense for damn near as long as I can remember. In 2014, Romo got us leads and Demarco closed them out. And if that didn't happen, we could always count on Romo to bring us back and give us a chance for that FG or game winning TD IF we got the last possesion. Please note that's our offense: getting us leads closing out games and/or bringing us back from the brink. Our defense rarely ever makes game changing plays when we need them. Because this teams defense SUCKS DICKS at closing out games when we have a lead. I had a feeling that every time we are up by less than 8, and the opponent gets the ball in a situation where they will have the last possession, we're done. We cant' get any pressure on the QB, and in no huddle 2 minute drill it's just way to much pressure on our extremely below average defense to hold onto that lead. We saw it last year in OT 2 times. Neither time did the offense even get on the field and we lost. Reddit and PFF to the rescue here is the data since 2011 in the scenario where the Cowboys are either tied or ahead by less than 8 with 4 minutes to go in the 4th quarter. Dallas has allowed the most TDs in that time with 12. The Vikings have allowed the most total scoring plays with 21 Dallas has lost more games than any other team in the league in this scenario with 15 losses since 2011. That's out of 31 opportunities, which is 48.39% of the time. That's almost a full season worth of losses because our defense can't stop the opponent when it matters most. and in that time, Dallas has the worst percentage of all NFL teams. So with all that being said, looking at our current roster, what reasons do I have to believe our defense is better now at getting press ure and sealing wins. With Romo, there are games we'll win even though the defense gives up points at the end of games as long as there is SOME time left for him to use his magic. But if he goes down, and he probably will at some point, we're doomed. I do believe if we have Romo, and Elliot playing well that we can close out games using our offense, but that's such a damn risky proposition. Because your a one trick pony at that point, and if that pony gets hurt in any significant way, again, we're doomed. ..discuss"

One of the major flaws of the flintlock design is that you have to rely on there being powder outside of the weapon, and you have to rely on the frizzen to keep it in place. A problem with this a lot of people discovered the hard way is that after a vigorous activity like climbing a tree, riding a horse, or clubbing someone with the gun the frizzen can swing open. Even if it barely opens up the powder inside the pan can spill out. So if you have it completely loaded, ready to go, and you swing it, the frizzen could open up, and spill your powder leaving the gun unable to fire."

My current company has health insurance at a good rate, but if I sign up for the family plan, it ends up taking about 25% of my paycheck which would be extremely unaffordable. This, combined with my wife's unpaid maternity leave, puts us in a very bad spot. What are our options for my wife to get affordable coverage? Any suggestions are welcome. We live in NY."

1,Allah knows best brother,"An argument I never forgot. When I was a teenager more than 10 years ago I was a fully committed Muslim who was keen on spreading the word of Mohammed. I went on Paltalk (if any of you remember what that is, it's a voice-chat-room client) and started arguments against Christians and the sort after watching Ahmad Deedat and the works. Then one day an atheist (who's name passes me) asked a simple question: **Here's the argument:** When the devil disobeyed god, god damned him. Damning, meaning the devil will never be allowed into heaven. Then how the hell did the devil sneak back into heaven to trick Adam and Eve? Was God unaware? Was he too weak to guard his borders? What kind of God can't back his own word? This is where I started to logically question all the things I was told, the stories always fell apart when you applied logic. Now, I'm not sure if that particular story has an actual answer or if it is solid. Was the devil waiting for his damnation to be processed by bureaucratic angels? Who knows? But it set something off in me, and I thank those people for making good logical arguments (even though they were pretty snobby and rude about it). It was worth it in the end."

Happened again later, this one was the most unbelievable. A guy I was right behind not even a few feet away. Shot him in the back with a shotgun, no hit marker. While my character pumped the shotgun he turned around, and I shot him again, this time even closer and with my crosshair on his chest. No hit marker again. Then he headshots me with an AR before I could shoot again. And finally just now, when I had a medium range encounter with my AK. I held down the trigger and actually did a surprisingly good job of keeping the crosshair on him, because I'm usually pretty bad with the AK. I was proud of myself until I realized I didn't get any hit markers until the last 2-3 bullets but it was too late and I he killed me? I fired over half a clip.. Not sure what to say. I don't recall having this problem in the old H1."

1,"No, and it doesn't look like it's one of the most requested features","Would you like to see a Pokemon Sun &amp; Moon difficulty option? Since growing up with the first 3 generations of Pokemon games I eventually grew out of it a bit. However I revisited the series when Black and White was released and have since purchased every entry. I feel that the series has become way too easy, I know what you're thinking the series is aimed at children but does that mean we shouldn't have a difficulty setting to appeal to an older audience? I feel that there was at least some degree of difficulty in the older games but now they're a joke. Maybe I'm just a overall a better gamer but short of the free legendaries, dumb AI, and being given EXP share at the beginning of the game (which applies to all of your Pokemon) I feel like the series could benefit from a increased difficulty mechanic. This could make trainers more combat aggressive, carry more Pokemon for you to battle against and even removing the option to switch out of battle without missing a turn would be a great start. I'd certainly play a game like that, what do you think?"

1,Seize him guys!,"I love Pebble, but I'm moving to Apple Watch I've worn both the OG and PTR for a combined two years. I fell in love with both of them and soon found myself panicking if I left my watch at home. They helped me drastically reduce the number of times I pulled out my phone and completely erased my ""what if they responded"" anxiety. So when I bought an Apple Watch during a very impulsive binge shopping spree, I figured I'd just try it out and return it. Figured the complaints about the battery life and slowness would immediately turn me off. Well, I was wrong. I fell in love with it, hard. The number of very useful apps for things I already used on my phone was amazing, and I found the health features to be more helpful for me. I'm not saying the Apple Watch is objectively better than Pebble. It's going to come down to personal preference. If you want something basic that stays out of the way and keeps things simple, Pebble is fantastic for that. For me, I appreciate the interaction options with Apple notifications and being able to quickly give input to certain apps. And I've made use of Siri and receiving calls directly on the Watch far more than I thought I would. So Pebble, it's been fun, and I may eventually be back. For now, though, I'm jumping ship. On a side note, I will be selling my silver/white PTR (smaller size). There is a slight scuff on the screen (just looks like a tiny smudge) but otherwise clean. I have both the red leather band (looks worn) and the silver mesh Pebble band. So if anyone is interested, feel free to message me!"

I had been there for 2 months and we were having our zone meeting that morning. When my companion and I got to the church building in downtown Valparaiso only the first plane had hit. Our entire zone was huddled around a little TV, probably thinking it was an accident, when the second tower got hit. The rest of the day is a blur, but for a couple weeks following the attack we were instructed to proselytize without our name tags on. We didn't get any grief from Chileans on the streets or from members. Our mission president was a good person, but didn't have a lot to say about the tragedy. It was supposed to be just business as usual."

1,Transgender people would not exist if there were no gender roles.,"Transgender isn't about gender roles, right? Everywhere I go it seems people keep basing transgender dysphoria off of feminine/masculine personality traits or traditional gender roles in order to invalidate transgender people, but what I keep basing it off is what you'd prefer your body to look like and/or which community you feel best represented by or comfortable with. Seeing people saying that because they play sports but don't identify as male or they can wear dresses but don't need to be a transwoman means transgender people are just silly and don't exist keeps bothering me - I feel sometimes the majority must be right and I'm just stupid but surely the people saying transgender people aren't right must be wrong, right?

And what did the west do? Absolutely nothing. We didn't even arm the Ukranians. We sat back and scolded Russia and imposed some sanctions that did nothing. Putin has free reign to do as he wishes. Why? Because the west is full of absolutely spineless leaders."

They should've let them fail. In terms of oil, at this point regardless of all the green energy in the world, we still need oil. Hopefully not forever, but for the time being we need them.

Use some of the taxes to fund treatment programs for adults who want them. This will put all drug gangs out of business and greatly reduce crime. The concept of treating grown adults as idiots when it comes to intoxicants is relatively new and grew out of that other failed experiment, prohibition of alcohol. Ideally no-one would use drugs or use only the more innocuous ones like weed and mescaline - people should be able to make that choice themselves without funding criminals and without further risking their lives over QC issues and with vast amounts of extra taxation for the government which could be put to good use."

1,I can't find the,"Grade should probably do some research before ranting about how stupid things are I unsubscribed because it looks like every other video is just Grade ranting about shit he doesn't really understand. I used to love him, but it's kinda hard to watch videos about some guy calling something stupid when he clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. For example, the animals video. He mentions how it's stupid that Crocodiles and Alligators are a different species, same for Coyotes, Foxes, Jackals, and Wolves, but that dogs are all the same species. That's not how it works. And in the phobia video, he says that phobias are dumb because being afraid of spiders is rational really misses the point. If phobias are irrational, and something you think is a phobia is rational, *then maybe it's not a phobia*. A phobia isn't not going in your bathtub because there's a spider in there and they're spooky, it's like not going home because there's nobody on guard for spiders and a spider might have found there way in there, even though there's no reason to believe one did or that it'll disrupt anything. That's not all! Then there's the alphabet one, the one with the letters &amp; numbers that mentions vitamins, the autocorrect one all coming off as stupid. And then there are others that while not as bad as those, aren't perfect either. I feel like there's gonna be comments on how I'm being super pretentious and shit, but I'm really not. All I'm saying is maybe don't do topics that you don't know anything about so you look like less of an idiot. PS: I made a throwaway account because last time I saw someone talk negatively about Grade, he raged and hated on the guy, even though he gave polite, constructive criticism. I don't trust that Grade won't attract unwanted attention to my Reddit account."

I liked Monte until I tried watching him on the feeds and in any one on one conversation, he's just interrupting and talking over the other person.

So I'm predicting next week we will see the Halloween update with a 3 week even run similar to the Summer Games. While many want an event currency, I'll predict we don't see it as Blizzard seemed, at least outwardly, satisfied with the even. By running three weeks it would be complete just a bit before Blizzcon. I'm predicting Sombra will be announced mid October with teasers and announced as playable at Blizzcon similar to Eichenwalde at Gamescom.

It's weird as fuck. He seems to be a great OC, but it might just have been a Peyton Manning-induced confidence."

1,Give Brother Trump a break!,"Apologists for Trump Some audio recordings have surfaced recently that allegedly show Mr. Trump engaging in lewd and disrespectful conversations towards women. These tapes have been released by Anti-Trump activists in an effort to discredit his candidacy and leadership. These critics have gone as far as to demand that Trump resign his candidacy. As is expected, these critics have failed to evaluate all the available information, and have chosen a very narrow interpretation of the facts we have available to us, opting instead for media-friendly soundbytes that demonize Mr. Trump. The basis for these claims is a single low-quality recording of Mr. Trump engaging in a conversation with another man. A layperson listening to this tape will conclude that the speaker is Donald Trump, but voice analysis and identification is a complex field, and it's easy to jump onto the media bandwagon without proper analysis. Voice identification is more ""art"" than science, and many states don't even allow voice identification to be entered into evidence. Even with leading voice identification techniques, we can only be 99.9% sure that the voice on the recording is Donald Trump's voice. While this is touted by critics as a smoking gun, what they fail to mention is that even with these odds, there are tens of thousands of *other* people whose voice matches the recording. How can we be certain that the voice we've heard is in fact Mr. Trump's? There are over 100 million citizens that have pledged their support for Mr. Trump. If Mr. Trump was really a horrible mysogynist as he's painted to be, how could so many people be misled? And with so many Trump supporters, couldn't we reasonably expect that there would be more than just a single low-quality recording as evidence for his behavior? With all the people he comes in contact with, you would expect more evidence against him. When it comes to Anti-Trump supporters, you will find that they make wild claims against him, but almost always fall short when it comes to producing evidence. Even with taking the recording at face value, it requires a number of significant logical leaps to conclude that Donald Trump was saying the types of things he's being accused of. Most of the recording is actually very benign in nature, and even sentimental as he talks about taking his wife furniture shopping. For example, Donald talks about taking a woman named ""Nancy"" to go furniture shopping. It's automatically assumed that he's referring to someone besides his wife, Melania. However, in American slang, men often refer to beautiful women as ""nancy"", so it would be natural for a man to refer to his wife as nancy. Plus, wouldn't you naturally go furniture shopping with someone you share a home with? It's a big stretch to assume that Donald would engage in an illicit affair by participating in such a domestic activity. Donald's critics have really outdone themselves on this one. What's next? Donald is trying to convince a woman to have sex by purchasing her some cleaning supplies at Walmart? Next, Donald is accused of embracing rape culture by using his social status to kiss and grope women. This claim is so ridiculous on its own that is hardly merits a rebuttal, but we live in a world where even the most ludicrous of claims can spread if they are unchallenged. If Donald Trump really behaved in this way, we would expect to see hundreds of videos of Mr. Trump forcing himself onto women, attempting to kiss them or to grab their genitals. To date, we don't have a single video of this type of behavior, or even a reliable report of such behavior. The lack of evidence speaks volumes. The most inflammatory part of the recording was Donald's use of the term ""pussy"". As we're aware, one of the meanings of this word in American slang is very vulgar and refers to women's genitalia. However, critics fail to explore other common meanings that actually make more sense. The second most well-known meaning is short for ""pussycat"", a common name for a cat. At the time of the alleged recordings, a very famous singing group named The Pussycat Dolls enjoyed widespread success. During this time period, the use of the word ""pussy"" increased dramatically. It's easy for us recoil at hearing this word today, and failing to realize that this was a very common word used in 2005. Also, ""grab the cat by the tail"" is probably one of the oldest and most widely used expressions in the English language. Further, cats have a reputation for short attention span, so the phrase ""grab them by the pussy"" would be a short way of Mr. Trump saying that he was always trying to grab and keep the attention of females during their courtships. It's amazing how these types of accusations can be ... oh... wait... really?? ok... Donald Trump has just confirmed that it was his voice on the tapes, and issued an apology for the language he used. It's not uncommon for us to want our leaders to be perfect, but reading through history and the scriptures, we learn that even the most powerful leader has momentary lapses in judgement. For example, Lot had sex with his daughters, and Noah got drunk and laid out without any clothes on. However, when we understand that our leaders are human, it can add richness and depth to their character, and help us to appreciate them on a deeper, more nuanced level. The message is true, and it's imperative that you donate to the campaign and push this election forward."

1,Hats,"Keep the skins rare... Read before replying. So with the upcoming Halloween update coming soon I've seen so many people saying that the skins should be buyable with gold... For me this eliminates the point of having a special seasonal event with rare items. If you could buy the skins with gold, everyone would have them, as Blizzard hasn't given us many new skins that could be bought with gold most people have lots of currency saved up. So would the Mcree skin be as cool if every single game everyone has it? I don't think so. I don't think their current seasonal event system is perfect, in my opinion you should be able to get Halloween loot from duplicates/ loot boxes maybe?

I wanted to ask if any of you have felt the same way about a show before. TL;DR: I love animation. I am not enjoying SDF Macross as much because of the constant drops in animation. Do you have shows like this??

You can't say outrageous things to a national audience and get mad when the national audience listens.

1,"This just in, grouping up with randoms for xp is bad; this needs a nerf","Competitive should reward more xp and groups less You get 20% xp bonus for playing with 1 friend. A lot of people abuse this and the general chat is often spammed with people who want to group just for xp. Also comp rewarding less xp than casual seems stupid.

This will take care of people abusing since 3% isn't much and 20% is too much Then competitive should have a passive 25% xp bonus (value can change). This will encourage more people to comp. Maybe even add a ""first competitive game of the day"" bonus like first win And last, brawls should reward same amount of xp as quick play"
