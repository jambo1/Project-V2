1,Haven't seen these exact criticisms before.,"Everything Dean Ambrose does inside the ring looks utterly fake. Sorry, i just can't get behind the guy. He has great in ring psychology, a great talker, awesome energy and has the look to make it in the WWE. But inside the ring, every punch, kick, rope move, movement, it just seems completely fake and forced. Two times during the match he did that stupid 2nd rope bounce. First, it never looks real, makes absolutely no sense and takes a stupid amount of preparation to even make the move while the opponent stands there waiting for him to do it. By far the worst move in his arsenal. Every other moves just seems so... fake, like he's a bad physical actor, when i am watching guys like AJ, Seth, Jericho, i can believe that that is a real move within the WWE realm, but the ones done by Ambrose always, always look fake... Can't remember one wrestler who always seems fake. p.s. personal opinion, what do you guys think."

1,Blizzard should also add a trading system so we can trade skins and things like that.,"OverWatch ""LoadOuts"": Is overwatch combat diverse enough? I've had this thought in my mind for a long time now, about how overwatches combat design is very simple. We get to choose a hero, the hero has a kit and you go kill some dudes. It's a good formula, and it works. My idea takes the original idea and builds upon it, Keep in mind these ideas I am presenting don't necessarily have to or will ever have an impact on the current state of the game. That being said I want overwatch to introduce ""Loadouts"". Loadouts would work similar to how the league of legends rune system would work where people could choose how to improve their gameplay through through additional increases in stats or even passive abilities, this would introduce strategic diversity among the champion pools. This would give players more to think of when playing this competitive mode. Example: a loadout could include an increase to the shield power of winston's shield (E) along with more damage with a trade off for less HP and mobility. Perhaps. This is just a basic/rough concept of how it would work, please tell me how it would be broken or otherwise. My other idea was something that came to me when they announced sym getting two different ultimate abilities. My idea takes that further and allows each hero to have two different kits. This gives players more options for their play styles and changes the dynamic of the game. This idea would most likely take up a lot of resources and less likely to happen. And lastly these changes would happen on a different game mode, so as to not effect the original style."

In a game, people gave him shit and told him he wasn't doing well, even though he had gold damage and elims, which are the only ways for them to gauge his performance. Now, of course, Soldier might not work because of the enemy comp, and if they'd said that, fair, but they told him to switch so *someone else* could play Soldier and do it better. And the entire team jumped on that. Not because they needed another hero instead of Soldier, but because they had somehow gotten it into their heads that the only reason they were losing was because of the gold Soldier being bad at Soldier. And that was enough for them to bully and moan the entire match. It was one of the stupidest things I've ever witnessed."

We have a de facto one-party system that serves the interests of one class, the Business/Capitalist class. Those with concentrated wealth can concentrate political power, which in turn gives them more wealth, which in turn gives them more political power. People arguing about government regulators and corporate executives don't seem to realize that *those are often the same people*. We have a revolving door at the top of myriad government agencies where a handful of people gladly exchange their golden parachutes for bureaucratic red tape and are free to scratch the backs of their fellow industry friends for a few years before they shuffle on out to some other top gig at some other corporation where they can reap the bountiful rewards of the policies they crafted. Yes, there are laws that are supposed to curtail this very type of activity, but they're largely ineffective and really just part of the greater facade of democracy we've cultivated in America."

1,Yeah and I'm sure the tens of thousands of innocent Japanese Christians had it coming too.,"The Real History is the Japanese didn't ""buy-in"" to voluntary extortion white religious imprisonment. Throwing out the white European 'christians' is what lead Japan to close its ports for over 200 years. The Japanese saw the Holy Roman Church was using Jesuits as their exploratory invasion force, with their ""We Come In Peace"" routine. In Nagasaki, there is the site where a barrel the size of a large swimming pool was filled with boiling oil and 38 priests were thrown into that. Scorsese actually gets a lot of reality mixed in with his movies. Several scenes are real scenes in real life, like the scene in Casino where Nicky and his brother dig their own graves in a Kansas corn field, stripped to their underwear and beaten with baseball bats until they were *almost* dead, then thrown into the grave and buried alive. There are news photos from the discovery of their bodies, and Scorcese had the scene laid out just like it happened. He is showing the extremely close relationship of the Mafia with the Pope in his Godfather movies. He seems to be sending the message about how evil the Holy Roman Church has been, so it will be interesting to see how he portrays this pivotal period."

From what I understand, the quality of boot camp programs can vary a lot, even within the same organization. I'm super happy with mine. I think my campus has something like a ~90% placement rate for graduates, and it's in a growing tech area (Indianapolis). In researching their curriculum, I found some reviews that almost scared me off, but I went to a Meetup they hosted and a few other events, talked to alumni, saw how plugged in they are with the local tech community, and I was sold. I heard from multiple people that it's the best decision they've made for their careers. I'm not finished with the program, but so far, I'm inclined to agree. Do some local research if you're considering options. Don't trust Google'd reviews unless it's relevant to your local campus. Scope out the relationships and connections with area tech employers. Talk to alumni, especially; they'll know better than anyone if it's ""worth it"". tl;dr - Maybe."
0,"Dude, the only reason to move back dinner is that dinner isn't done.","Got a lovely reminder why I'm not close with my family Thanksgiving is supposed to be a great day, right? Family and all that jazz. Well, here are the bullet points from yesterday: - Button is 18 months next week. Does not like long drives. Scream cried the last 40 minutes of the drive. - We started the 2 hour drive around nap time. Button did not nap. On our way, we were told that the dinner planned for 3 was being moved to 6. Because of my sister, L. - Dinner was moved because she was driving in from a few states away and wanted a shower first when she got here. Yep. Whole dinner moved 3 hours. For her. One person. - L was over an hour late from the time she said she would be there. Food got cold. Her husband let it slip to my husband that they went to their in laws (his parents) first for dinner. She held up the entire dinner so she could go to another party first. - Decided to do the ""prayer"" and talked about how she drove all day, had to leave the next day, and was thankful to get to eat all the food and that someone else cooked. - Button did NOT nap. She ate at 6 because fuck everyone else. We left immediately after she got there. She didn't even hardly say hi to me. - If you think I was quiet about this, I wasn't. I told my family that we will not be doing this again. That it was rude and selfish of her and that our daughter was the one who suffers for it. The excuse ""Well, it's thanksgiving"" earned a hearty ""fuck you"" from me. - So from now on, unless it's my Uncle hosting, we are not going. Period. My Uncle gives no fucks and waits for no one. I'm not dealing with her bullshit again. My husband and I also called this. I said that she was going to somehow hijack the holiday, because she always does. - Oh, and I just got a group text from her to my and my other sister thanking us for cooking, saying it was the best she has had in months and how she has barely eaten. Martyr much? Yeah, not responding. - Did I mention I haven't been home in 3 years either? Yeah."

0,"I don't know, pretty sure Lewis just wants to be a kick ass wizard by himself.","I really wish Sjin had a better understanding of what Lewis is doing. Lewis alluded to it in episode 3, but just to spell it out clearly: Lewis has a near-compulsive need to take control. I'm not saying this as criticism, it has made the Yogscast what it is today. But it is *especially* true in a sandbox game when there are various jobs/tasks for people to do. If Lewis stuck with the group, he wouldn't be able to resist taking over and telling everyone what to do. Lewis is going hard-RP because he knows this about himself. This is Sjin's series on Sjin's channel and this is Lewis' way of letting Sjin be in charge. I see this as Lewis showing great self-awareness and I applaud him for it. I just wish Sjin could see it, instead of thinking that Lewis is not helping by running away. Sjin: ""You ran away!"" Lewis: ""I did not run away. I went off on my own because I didn't want to get in your way."""

The way your mind reads a price like $6.75 is ""six dollars plus a little something"". If the post-tax price was shown your mind would read it as ""seven dollars plus a little something"". That difference is enough to cause some lost sales, so everyone does it the first way.

1,Don't worry they'll get people to repair people's because there's so going to be demand for 100000s of repair people in a given area !,"That's a false conclusion. Two examples that are more local are: the self checkout at many major department stores. One person watching over 6-12 self checkout lanes is not making 6-12 times what one register clerk makes. So even with the labor pricing staying the same there is still phasing out of employees. Another is Walmart laying off 91 people in their optical labs. White collar jobs that require at least some modicum of being above the lowest common denominator are still at risk. The final and less local example is Foxconn. You may remember this company for making the news due to work related stress induced suicide attempts. They just announced 60,000 layoffs. It's a Chinese company and organizations have been outsourcing to China for slave labor wages for decades. Line all of those up. You can't get paid the same always, or you face replacement. You can't be paid above the average because it is work related replacement due to automation. You can't even be slaved to mental collapse. If a job can somehow be replaced by automation, it will. Employee payment has literally nothing to do with it. Lights out factories exist. One or two rooms in a facility where humans regularly occupy the space, the rest of the rooms can be completely dark with no hiccups. Bill gates says society isn't ready for the amount of job loss automation will spur on. This finger pointing to people who deserve a fair and living wage is proof of it"

Adding more random events would be awesome. I've seen many posts about people's ideas for random events, but here's some of mine. Military Squad: A squad of military soldiers spawns at the top of the map, and will hunt players. Their weapons would include MP5s, LR300s, 92s and M249s, but also new military weapons such as AT4s, AWSMs, Desert Eagles and Tavor-21s. All of these weapons would drop. They would have exclusive military grade armour, which would be Helmet: Military Helmet, Top: BDU Top, Vest: Kevlar vest, Pants: BDU Pants, Gloves: Tactical Gloves (Also have a special ability to punch without any weapon) and Boots: BDU Boots M1 Abrams: A tank arrives at the coast (away from spawn) via a transport boat. It will only target players with a mid tier or better gun in their hot bar and at least 3 clothing items on. It would be extremely durable, and would have two firing modes, Cannon, which it aims its Cannon at a player and then fires a tank shell which does 200 Blunt and 300 Explosive Damage. Its other mode, Machine Gun, sprays bullets at players, dealing medium damage. Destroying the Tank makes the engine explode, and set fire for several minutes. It's crates would be similiar to the helicopter's crates. Ground Zero: At a random monument a nuclear siren will alarm. 45 seconds later, a nuclear missile will be visible and will hit the centre of the monument, turning every animal rad and increasing the radiation. The initial blast does 1000 explosive damage in a 30m squared radius. Shortly after, a squad of hazmat soldiers arrives and will kill anyone who is not in a hazmat suit. On death, the hazmat soldiers drop military grade weapons and hazmat suits."

My top three: 1) Mysterio - my absolute favorite villain in the entire marvel universe. I would want a classic version of the character, fish bowl and all. Can you imagine how visually appealing his skills would be since they're illusion-based? I don't know if it'll ever happen, but here's to hoping. 2) Wonder Man - Another one of my all-time favorites. I'd love to see Wonder Man in this game, especially with an ultimate style costume where he's basically living ionic energy. 3) Nova (Richard Rider) - cosmic heroes are extremely cool and Nova feels far overdue, especially since the Nova corps are in the game. Honorable mention: Howard the Duck - Quack-Fu. That is all."

0,"Did something like this but found out that they will hone in directry to ""vault"" door aka dig the brix out of mountain wall ..","I haven't tested this yet, but I have a defense theory for tunnel defense. It's a theory, so take this with a grain of salt. Start with your tunnel, and go down the tunnel at least 10 blocks or so, preferably deeper. In fact, deeper would be better, but a minimum of 10 blocks in. Dig yourself a pit, using the tunnel as your center, about 3 blocks to both sides, about 8 blocks down the length of the tunnel, and maybe seven blocks down (lower is okay). Reinforce that pit with the best materials you have, because it's going to take a lot of damage. Now, build an iron ledge on the side of the pit where the tunnel leads to your base, maybe two blocks out. This is to protect against the spider zombies and to put you roughly in the middle of the pit. Build a temp bridge so you can cross to the tunnel normally... you'll be removing it during the horde. At the bottom of the pit, cover it in spikes, the best you can make. You'll be replacing these after each horde, guaranteed, so don't get attached to them. When the horde hits, remove the temp bridge, and wait for them to show up. Stand on your iron ledge, and watch them shove each other into the bridge. They'll start taking damage and tearing everything up, including the walls, but you should be high above them as they are roaming around. Let them build up down there for a little bit, and when you think the time is right.... drop bombs on them. Fire is also quite useful, I'd think drop both down there. With the bombs, fire, and spikes all doing their work, even the strongest zombies are going to have a bad day. If flyers manage to get in, you'll be able to back into the tunnel and fight them with melee. This setup will likely leave ferals alive, you'll have to shoot them to death, but you should be safe while they struggle in the pit. Cops will likely try to snipe you from across the tunnel, but they're going to be getting shoved into the pit from the other zombies or shooting their fellow zombies in the back, and you can gun them down from a distance... now that I think of it, putting a defensive barrier of some sort to hide behind would be a good idea. Give it a try, I'm curious how effective it is. I'm going to be trying this when I start my new game next week."

1,Spoken like a true Tumblrina,"Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to eat 800 big Macs, but take it from this old McDonald's rat, I've spent my entire adult life eating at McDonnald's, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. If you only eat big Macs one part of your body (and that's all a single burger type like Big Mac is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. Big Macs basically only train the gut muscles and to some extent, the esophagus. What you really want to do is train your entire digestive system, all the major gut groups (esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, and kidneys) at the same time, over the course of a Big Mac meal. So, you will need to add large Big fries, and Large coke with it. Ask for the ""Go Big"" program. I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three big meals! Falling in love with eating big Macs, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find any McDonnald near you, with qualified burger flippers who will design your burger for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fatness. Three to 5 burgers a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being out of shape the first time you walk into McDonnalds. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway. Now get out there and get fat! :-)"

So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help. ""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many."" The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting. ""Are you sure?"" asks the farmer, ""I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up."". ""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen."" ""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home. That afternoon, the farmer and the dog walk together up hill, and from the top they can see the entire flock covering the fields. ""Well,"" says the farmer, ""I'd like you to round up all of these sheep."". ""Okay."" replies the dog, ""You have nine hundred sheep."""

0,r/buyitforlife,"It's a common event even today. My parents furniture older than me? Still looks good and functions today. Furniture I bought for the same price (inflation adjusted)? Broken after a few years. Toys my parents bought for me (connect 4, hungry hippos and more)? Worked for years and eventually sold at yard sales. I bought the same games for my kids and plastic pieces snapped/bent within a month. The TV my grandparents had worked for something like 40 years. In the nonstop quest for saving a few bucks, people have slowly opted for total shit over something that works. I don't blame companies at all for making the crap they do. I'd bet anything they were shocked and confused as people were purchasing wildly inferior products for slightly cheaper than their high quality products. Sure the competitor might look and function the same today, but in a year or two it would fail while the other would keep marching on. Over time it became a race to the bottom, to make the cheapest possible kind of everything. The story above isn't about an evil company, it's about a horde of uninformed consumers purchasing the cheapest crap they can find. I'd bet their sales were slowly suffering, with outlook getting bleaker by the year. Eventually they made the hard decision to not fight the tide anymore."

The electorate gave that a chance, and decided it didn't work out for them. Centrist liberal elite parties are getting decimated all across the Western world. I think I most strongly just agree with your last sentence; I don't think Labour will seriously recover, even if we tossed Corbyn and found ourselves the idealized perfect leader who could please everyone in the party, unless the current neo-authoritarian political force just cocks up completely and gives liberalism leftism a chance to make its case again. I feel all Labour can do is wait and grimly cling on, trying to weather it as best as possible."

Adding an actual semicompetitive q would split the player base tho, but honestly they could drop a few game modes that they don't update, balance for, or put at the bottom of the list where no one can even fucking see it to q Just a thought from a player that doesn't want the commitment or stress of ranked, but does want the competitiveness/giving a shitness of ranked"

The talk of a rigged election is either a face-saving measure being taken by someone very aware of the brand perception around his name (and therefore his wallet), someone priming the collective id of his followers to subscribe to a countercultural movement (like the TV network), or both. I don't know that I'd call Donald Trump a smart guy, but he's very calculating, at the least - I'm guessing he's got a few contingency plans to make sure that he gets his no matter *what* happens to the country in the process."

Some people do it on leg day instead but I'm personally not a fan of it. You can do shoulders on a separate day as well but then it's essentially a typical brosplit. You can then do shoulders + arms on that day instead of doing tri/bi on push/pull. But the main reason I'm running PPL is because I want to hit the same muscle groups twice a week and if you have an extra day for shoulders it will be one extra day between every Push/Pull/Legs if you know what I mean.

I don't consider anything filler and no stretch of the album seems weaker than any other stretch, so it's a consistent listen across the board. Cons: * This album doesn't really go anywhere, at least on the surface. After I finished it, I was just kind of like ""what was that?"" As I listen more and more, it gets a little better, but I wish it was more cohesive or at least had something stand out. * The vocoder can get a little irritating at times. Not too bad since I only notice this on California. Imo it's an 8.5/10. Not a lot to complain about. I'm on my fifth listen and it gets a little nicer each time. Pretty solid album. I do have to admit that I miss his rapping and more conventional songs. I appreciate the direction and I'm interested to see where he goes."

1,Obviously you can't survive a scooping because the scooper hits you right in the nutsack at high speeds,"Why Does Everyone Keep Saying That a Person Can't Survive Scooping? Every time the topic of scooping, the identity of Eggs, or the ending to the game is brought up, people immediately start reciting, ""You can't survive scooping!"" But why does everyone assume so? In truth, we don't actually know what happens when a human gets scooped. Nowhere in the game is it clarified, so don't go trying to pass speculation as fact. In reality, the only piece of evidence we have is that Ennard tells the player that, ""You won't die."" (side note: the final cutscene monologue's meaning is still up for debate, so whether or not it turns out that Michael believes the scooping should have killed him is unknown) Whether or not Ennard is a trustworthy source is arguable, but the possibility that scooping a human really doesn't kill them can't just be outright dismissed. Indeed, the only human we're aware of to be scooped, Eggs, survives. There might be some piece of actual evidence I'm forgetting, but it seems right now that a few people started saying that no one can survive scooping in order to make the events of the game agree with their headcanons, and now that there's evidence to the contrary, there are still a ton of people who still treat this speculation (albeit, reasonable speculation) as fact."

1,"Wait, Buck Lightyear and Androxus are enemies?","One thing that bothers me about Paladins and its Champions. Have you guys ever felt like the characters and the world of Paladins has too much of their own personalities and, most of the time, they don't seem to mix well togheter? When I first heard the name ""Paladins"", what I had in my was this medieval world where people battle using knights, magic and whatnot, but the game is set on a totally different reality. You have people using high technology powered by magical crystals, then you have people that haven't decided what they want to be... Have you guys taken a look at Skye? Like... she's an ELF, that uses technology to be hidden and pretend to be a JAPANESE NINJA? What about Grohk? He's an OGRE but, at the same time, a NATIVE AMERICAN? It feels like Grohk heard about World of Warcraft and went too literal on the Shaman look. He's blue, he's a native american and he uses a staff powered by crystals. Fernando, Bomb King, Cassie, Barik and Drogoz seem to be from the same ""Medieval Characters with magical hi-tech weapons"" pack, but at some point in development, they forgot about it and said ""Fuck it, we will have japanese elves, russian soldiers and that tree from the other game. - Oh shit, he doesn't have a weapon? Er... give him... an axe? You throw them, but he gets another one out of somewhere. Not to mention the characters are homeless. Why are the some many inca temples in the game? Why does Androxus is trying to destroy Buzz Lighthyear? Why does Sha Lin's bow deal more damage than Kinessa's fucking sniper rifle? Is it because he's asian? I think characters and the world itself has too much of their own and they hardly share characteristic with each other. If you look at TF2, they are all soldiers, fighting. On Street Fighters, they are all martial artists, humanoids and differentiate themselves by their nationality and culture. Paladins is a fat kid with a Naruto bandana on it's head and earphones pumping country songs."

Rural states get more voting power than states with large urban populations.

I already posted an intro video for it (Which should be somewhere in the hot posts I think?) and I have already finished the script for the first lore video. However, with the intro video I only used the intro cutscenes for Ocarina of time and Majora's Mask and I got copyrighted by Nintendo. Now I did not get a strike or anything for it but reading more into it; if I keep using gameplay of Zelda, I could actually get my youtube channel in trouble. It could technically never happen but it COULD. So my question is, what would you guys like to see in the video? I could try to fit images of something that's relating to what I'm saying in the video at the time instead of trying to put gameplay in there as that will result in more copyright trouble. Or I could put a non-zelda game gameplay in there BUT that wouldn't make sense to the lore but that's why I'm asking. What would you guys like to see? Should I keep on with gameplay and hope I don't get in trouble? Just try to find images and fit those in? Or put gameplay of something else on there? Let me know what you guys think! Once I get a good answer(s) I will start up on finishing my first lore video. I will post that here on the reddit so be on the lookout in a few days time! Cheers all"

0,"Me at 20 years old reading this ""....boooooring...let's party"" Now at 37 ""great advice wish I took it!""","I'm a CTO in town. If you want to talk privately about it, PM me. The tech workers with the best outcomes follow a simple plan: rent cheap (e.g. studio in Rainier Valley) until you can buy cheap (e.g. 1 br condo). I didn't. I rented a cool 2 br apartment and then a nice 3 br house for my first 5 years in town. That made it exceedingly painful when I bought a home; I could have saved $30,000 after everything was said and done if I'd been smart like that. Living with the parents is a stellar way to shortcut the process even further. Don't try to get to your happy point today. You'll pay for it for 10-20 years if you do. Figure out your saving plan for $100,000 and make it as fast as you can. If you stay at home you should be able to sock away $25,000 a year pretty easily and be a home owner at 26. The other side of the equation is to look at your income. You need to see your career arc in terms of at least three totally distinct tracks. For instance if you're in IT today, plot out your next 4 promotions. Skip from job to job if you can, but only when the new offer has a better title than the one you have today. Don't fret about salary; that always lags title if you're aggressive about promotions. It will catch up in spades. Use the time during your current track to get ready to switch tracks when you get to a senior, director, principal, or architect title. I switched from development (tester, programmer, senior prog, senior developer, software architect, principal architect) to security (security analyst, senior security researcher, senior security developer, director of security engineering) to management (project manager, program manager, director of engineering, VP technology, CTO). CTO income is somewhat better than tester income. Ideally, you'll do all three things at once: save hard like a war is coming, be aggressive about seeking promotions through company switch, and get training for your eventual track switch. The day will come when you sit up in bed and realize that none of the worries you have today matter at all any more."

0,You can stand up for what you believe in and still be at one with reality.,"I have a few philosophical and otherwise questions. The first one is: do you want young people to follow their dreams and stand up for what they believe? Or do you want them to be educated thoroughly until they have the correct opinion? These two options come in conflict to one another and you know it. So, do you think people should have the courage to stand up for what they believe in, or should they always question themselves and their knowledge? The second one is: do you think people should have the courage to express themselves and their opinion no matter what, or do you think they should ask first what the correct opinion is and then just express that? Somebody told me that I should always express myself and I should always vote, even if I'm not popular, especially if I'm not popular. If I refuse to express myself, I will be underrepresented and then nobody will take me seriously because I hadn't expressed myself. But I don't know what to say or think about this. Anyways, these questions are very important for me and my religion. They are very important. They are extremely important for me and my religion. So, should I stand by my convictions and post my conviction wherever I can and try to persuade people, or should I first inform myself and then ask people nicely if I'm allowed to speak?"

However, in HOTS I feel rather indifferent towards that type of champion, but I'm completely in love with supports like Brightwing or Auriel who I simply can't stop playing.

According to genesis the flood lasted 'forty days and forty nights"" Does this mean forty whole days of rain and forty more rains that occurred only in the evening? Then the ""fountains of the deep opened up"". Whatever the fountains of the earth are...aquifers? geysers? It does not specify. We are supposed to picture a whole lot of water. It covers up all the mountains. Noah, his family, (just eight adults), and all the animals slosh around in this boat for quite some time. The ark is not huge by any means. 50 cubits by 300 cubits with a height of 30 cubits. This strikes me as an incredibly narrow boat. Cubits are about 22 of our inches. Anyway. After Noah and his kin get washed around in this mountain covering flood for one hundred and fifty days they come to rest on top of a mountain. They get out. What then? A flood that bad would kill off everything. They would have no animals to eat, the land would be silted over, even if they did bring seeds it would not guarantee results. A person who in this day and age can actually believe that the bibical flood happened as genesis states can be made to believe anything. Any lie, any bit of propaganda, any advertisement, any politician's spiel. They will eat up bullshit with a spoon and think it tasty because their powers of reasoning has been suspended. For me the worst part of the whole noah story is it is fed to small children as a nice bible story. I recall vividly the Sunday school classes with little kids drawing away with crayons all the animals. It has animals in it! Kids will love it! Just don't let them think of all the new babies drowning, all the small children, and all the other animals that did not get to represent their species. Noah is truly an ugly story."

There are quite a few named weapon/gear out there so there is still a layer of RNG plus the usual stats roll RNG. I understand the point of making the item rare and the ""rewarding"" feeling a player gets when one drops, but the current system is just a painful grind. I know players who have ran lex over 300 times with no Barret Drop or a drop that is absolutely horrible. This scenario is also true for other players who are grinding the other missions for named items. yes i know you can be viable without Barrett.. i've been running reckless + skulls for a while now and I do very well in the DZ. However it is very frustrating to log in and see 90% of your friends running lex and the other 10% just being salty after running lex."

Is it because liberal policies are above the truth?

And no, I'm not referring to all the Cassie Porn. 1 Word: FURRIES. Furries seem to loe this game, for some reason, especially thanks to Pip. He's paired with EVERYONE, from Fernando to Bomb King. Drogoz is another big favorite. Now, imagine if, instead of the new Champion, we would have had an Actual Bear, or Bear Like Character, be it female or male. (I know from Smite that Hi Rez seems to have a problem with depicting monstrous or not-humanoid women, but *bear* with me (Eh)). Just think about the INFLUX of new players and fanart. Think of the MONEY, Hi Rez! All that sweet, untapped and quite sweaty money the furries would give you! Also, adding another generic badass normal character kind of takes away Victor Awesomes of being able to go toe to toe with Witches, Dragons and God Slayers with just an assault riffle and some grenades. So, Hi Rez, learn your lesson, stop releasing generic base female characters with generic kits and instead start releasing more animal-based characters, and you'll basically hit the jackpot."

Some of those things (like apartments, homes, workplaces) contain people. People tend to do poorly when they catch fire or are exposed to the toxic fumes that fire produces. So by continuing to use a device that can catch fire (at any time) then you are placing the people who live and work around you in danger. Unless you are literally sitting next to your phone 24 hours a day with a fire extinguisher in hand, there is no way you can guarantee that you aren't going to hurt somebody."

Tyson Gay and others have broken into the 9.7s and 9.6s since. Who knows what the standards will be in 20 years. Swimming records keep falling too. Katie Ledecky just destroyed a ton of her own world records, winning 4 golds and a silver at age 19 in Rio. Phelps had the greatest career of any Olympian by far. But Mark Spitz, Missy Franklin, Ledecky, and others have shown that winning 5ish golds in one Olympics isn't a unique thing that only Phelps could do.

Find a sound mod for the game. Don't like the HUD? Mod it out! But more and more now I see games where it is impossible to to alter the game in any way, shape or form. They're kept completely locked down from the end user. Mafia III is the example I'm thinking of now, but it is far from the other one. I would love to change a lot of things about that game, from the ever present mini map to the weird cloud lighting ... but there is no way in. You will google in vain for any real ""Mafia III tweaks"" or ""Mafia III mods."" There's nothing out there. Just a wasteland of media PR for the game and that's it ...

Been playing since Vanilla and I love the game in and out. However a lot of my friends have moved on and I've found myself not communicating with anyone anymore. I love going on but I find that within an hour or so, I just get bored and sign off because I really have no one to talk to. Guilds don't really feel like a community either, so I just feel sort of isolated. I am just looking for some people to chill with in game and do things. I'm between Regular Mythics and M+, but can never find groups. I don't really PvP due to my crushing lack of friends in game.

1,Your story makes me feel so safe.,"I'd like to share my hilarious/painful YYC airport security experience from today So today, my wife, 4 year old son and 7 month old daughter left for Winnipeg for Christmas (no, going to Winnipeg wasn't the painful part). Anyway, I decided to help out and got one of those accompanying passes to help my wife get to the gate with the kids. We get through the metal detectors, and first off, my wife and baby get randomly selected for swabbing. That was fine but they also wanted to do a thorough check of one of our bins with a carry-on case, my shoes, phone and wallet. Anyway, before they can do our bag, they were taking, I kid you not, twenty minutes to frisk every crevice of a lady in a wheelchair so while waiting I told my wife to just go ahead and take the kids to so she could feed the baby and get food for my son. Finally, they get to our bag, rifle through it and find my wife's breast pump. The security lady swabs it and puts the sample in the machine, and the alarm goes off. I'm told there is an ""inconclusive"" organic substance on my ""child monitor"". I clarify that it's a breast pump so it might be breast milk. Doesn't matter, they need to see my baby. Yep, that's right, they need my baby right away. So I ask for my shoes but the lady says I can't have them. Then they call over a security escort to escort me to find my ""high security risk"" baby and he sees in my socks and says ""you need your shoes on sir"". I reply that they won't give them to me at security. So they conduct a ""pat down"" of my shoes and give them to me. So we are looking for my family and the escort is all impatient and asks ""Can't you just contact them somehow?"" to which I ask ""With what? My phone you won't let me have?"" and he shuts up. We find my family, bring them back and we are explained that because of the inconclusive swab, they have to pat down and swab THE BABY and ONE parent of our choice. Uuuuuh, what? Now remember, they already swabbed the baby and my wife once. I mean it's great that only two of us need to be pat down, but how does that make any sense whatsoever?! So ya, half our family had to be pat down, but one had to be the 7 month old baby. I mean, as much as it would have been annoying, would it not make sense that our whole family had to be pat down? Were they worried our baby was a drug mule or something? And if they were worried, why was patting me down, when I'm not even going on the flight, a viable option? And my son, with his beady little eyes, how come he didn't raise any suspicion at all?! And if none of this makes any sense, why is this even a procedure at all?! Anyway, lesson learned. Never EVER bring a breast pump on carry-on. We only had it in there because our check in case was a tad over the weight limit."

0,Dude that's such a boss story.,"Lol, oooohhh reddit, you shouldn't ask me questions like this. I got necrotized pancreatitis. Woke up with a sharp pain in my stomach, pooped a sleeping pill and went back to sleep, woke up two hours later in intense pain. Called a ride and and hour and a half later I died in the ER. I spent a month in the ICU. It was kinda fun, they gave me some good drugs. I remember singing ""Swing Low Sweet Chariot"" at the top of my lungs. I also didnt like them stuffing the feeding tube down my nose and i kept screaming rape while they did it. The last time i went back to the hospital my nurse walks i. The room and just started hysterically lughing. She explained that she had been one of my nurses trying to get a feeding tube in me and told me that when my mom came in afterwords i was trying to convince her that the entire hospital staff was trying to rape me. The problem was that this time i had just had pretty intense surgery and when she told me the story with all the details i started laughing and it hurt so god damn bad, but i couldnt stop, so i was laughing and crying with pain and hitting the dilauded pump for a solid hour. The entire floor had this running joke that no matter what they did for me i would translate it as rape. Good times. They wouldn't give me any water and I tried to bribe everyone from my sister to the nurses to bring me water. My personal fave was that I tried to bribe my doc with cocaine. Good lord. So some of my roommates at the time were pretty hardcore Christians at the time and when their friends (these girls from the same church) came to visit I flashed them. And when I say ""flashed them"" I mean I pulled my hospital gown over my head and laid there. They still talk to me, mostly with pity tho, lol. I guess I died a few more times in the ICU. When they put a direct line in my heart/chest I ripped it out and nearly bled out. I ended up tied down in the bed and even then i mamaged to get an arm out so they had a damn alarm on my bed that would go off if i shifted my wait too much. I thpught they wpuld turn it off if i kept setting it off but nope, even after i set it off every five minutes all night long they kept it on. I am eternally grateful to those nurses for putting up with me. They had to dope me up with so many benzos I had quite a fun time whenever I could keep my eyes open. I guess I was tripping at points because I remember being tied down to the bed and I thought we were on a triain going thru the mountains and i thought my mom and the doc were having an affair. In fact, I remember calling my dad over and trying to explain that my mom and my doctor were fucking in the bathroom. It pissed me off so much when he started laughing. Fuck, I just realized you probably meant stories about people's reactions to thinking I was dead when I wasn't. It wasn't that interesting, it was mostly the fake people who are always commenting on your shit on Facebook but you know they don't really care about you, they just want to look cool. They posted all sorts of things about favorite memories with me and shit like that, but most of them were either completely made up memories or grossly exaggerated. One thing I did realize was that I don't need a lot of friends to be happy. In fact since this happened I have steadily dropped friends who I don't think would be there in a needy time and I have become much happier. Thanks for listening to me ramble."

I've heard it said that if a Pope were to publicly fall into heresy, he would immediately lose his office. That seems problematic for the authority of the Church's magisterium, however. It seems to render papal infallibility meaningless if we can just decided a pope was never pope and his ex cathedra statement wasn't real. Thoughts?"
1,How about just reduce her base AD by 5.,"Camille deserves nerfs - but lets do it right I've spammed the ever loving hell out of camille lately and have just recently hit mastery 7 on her, and I can confirm that she is busted. However I feel like what riot generally ends up doing is just nerfing the base stats or damage of a champ like her until she is effectively gutted. There are less drastic ways to nerf her that will still keep her as a viable pick, but not as oppressive. The main thing with her that makes her hilariously busted in my opinion is her ability to trade for free in lane with little to no counterplay for most opposing toplaners. Unless you are playing jax, poppy, or fiora, camille's lane is almost as abusive as renektons with her also scaling better into the game. The main issue is the q2 prep e-aa-q combo, which can deal an upwards of a third of someones health with absolutely no way to deal with it. So what are the best ways to nerf her? -Increased e cooldown in the early levels by a lot, I feel like a ~20 second cd will keep her ability to trade for free down -Remove attack speed buff on e, its a completely unnecessary stat boost and I'm not quite sure why its there -Make her shield health percentage scale by level, starting at 10% and increasing to 20% These nerfs will serve to bring her back in line without going too far, if she still needs nerfs after that she can get looked at again"

Ovechkin has 11 to Crosby's 6. * Ovechkin has a case of being the greatest LW in history. Crosby has no case of being the best center in history * Ovechkin has a case of being the greatest goal score in history. Crosby has no case of beng the best in a category (playmaking, goal scoring, hockey IQ etc.) * Ovechkin won all of his trohpies fairly.

0,"When the Lord wants ya, he wants ya.","Guys I need some encouragement. I've been a medic for about 4 months now and had a pt code a day after we ran on him and he refused transport. So the day before yesterday my crew and I ran on a 96 Yom pt who the family said hasnt been eating or drinking lately and has been overall weaker than usual. When we arrived on scene we found an A&amp;O pt with no chief complaint sitting on his couch. We ran vitals on him and did an assessment and everything came out WNL, with BP at 96/66 P 95-105 in a-fib (has HX) sating @ 96%. Family stated pt had appointment with his PCP the previous day and was diagnosed with failure to thrive. I explained to the family that there's only a limited amount of tests we could do, abd since pt was stable there wasn't much we could do for the pt without transport. I advised them we could transport him to hospital for further tests but pt refused and his wife whom makes medical decisions stated that if pt didn't want to be transported he doesn't have to be. I suggested they make a follow up appointment and look into hospice care. We didn't do a 12 lead, which I should have to cover all my bases. I feel like I explained all the risks to the family but I honestly didn't expect him to code so soon. I knew it was inevitable because of his age and previous diagnosis but I didn't push for him to be transported.

1,Why would I want wards when I can double kill bot lane as support Lux,"What if upgrading sightstone opens up a special slot for control ward Sometimes when i play support and the games drag out to a long period of time, both teams have max items except for the support, who has to empty out a slot for the control ward, and usually gets smashed by enemy adc due to lack of an extra tank item. Some may argue not getting an control ward solves the problem easily, but for a support wards are their only pride they leave on the map as dominance. Which is why i thought, why not giving a sightstone upgrade that grants the player an extra slot **ONLY** for control ward. Or better, a *refillable* control ward. (Might prove^too^overpowered?) I feel that this gives the sightstone a sense of uniqueness with the addition of an upgrade, since sightstone=refillable wards; and sightstone+ = control ward slot (or refillable control wards). Just my thoughts on making a support life easier, helping to get rid of the frustration of a support to keep a empty slot when everyone is full items, and you're just gonna get chunked out while peeling for your adc. Cheers!"

1,"Nope, record is all that matters, Sun belt is clearly the best!","Why is ""Overall Bowl Record"" considered a useful metric for determining the comparative strength of conferences? Aren't the bowl games chosen to be fairly even? I think the title is pretty self explanatory. it seems that total wins and losses in bowl games is given a lot of importance when it comes to comparing the strength of conferences, when to me it seems pretty arbitrary. Part of the criteria for selecting bowl games is that they will be fairly even, and interesting to watch, right? If Penn State loses to USC, that will count against the bowl game record for the Big 10, yet if Penn State had played worse in the regular season and then beaten an easy bowl opponent, that would somehow count *for* the Big 10 being strong? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I guess I can see how it's some sort of metric of ""overratedness"". I.e. if you are assigned an opponent you were considered to be roughly equal to, and then get blown out, then maybe you weren't as good as we thought. But a measure of how ""overrated"" teams are is not directly related to how strong they are. A conference could be assigned a bunch of weak bowl opponents, beat them, and that might not necessarily mean they were any better than a conference that went even with tougher bowl opponents."

1,yep just like pc gaming,"Is Airsoft Dying? So this is a topic that isn't really covered to much but I feel it needs to really be addressed. I've seen a bit of people on YouTube and other social media platforms talking about it so here is my take of it. Atleast for me at my local field it seems like there is less and less players coming. That itself doesn't mean to much because it's just one field but after talking to my friends, even some from out of my state, most if not all said that their local fields are also not getting as many players as the used to get. Does this mean Airsoft is dying? No not at all it just means that it is expanding faster than the current player base can handle. Back in 2012 there was a huge spike of new Airsoft players and a bunch of new fields and Airsoft retailers and manufacturers opened up. Fast forward 4 years and it has leveled back out to its normal rate of players. All of those manufacturers and fields are now hyper splitting the Airsoft community to give the illusion of less players. That is also the reason why we saw a lot of Airsoft manufacturers go out of business because they expected that huge spike to keep going but it leveled out instead of rising more. Airsoft as a whole isn't dying it is just being hyper split across more and more fields. In a few years a bit of fields will go out of business due to the hyper split player base but that will bring larger numbers back into the other fields and the whole spike in player base and hyper splitting will start all over again."

0,"Good info, and i'll keep all of this in mind :) thank you!","You and your friend learned a valuable and important lesson about Dark Souls invasions. The best thing to do is to go *all out* when you get invaded. Any good invader will come into your world fully prepared to give you the hardest time he can. It would be disrespectful to resort to ""honor rules"" and not do the same. Ganking an invader IS honorable, if you're co-oping. These are some other things I would suggest you can do to ""gank with honor"", take whichever ones you like the sound of: * Bow or wave when you meet the invader, and bow after you beat him. NEVER Point-Down after you beat him, Point-Down is equivalent of saying ""fuck you weakling"", Applause is equivalent to ""good job idiot"", be good sports instead. * Never disconnect on purpose to avoid being killed. Ideally, don't suicide either. * Stand your ground and fight one-on-one if your friend is killed in the 2 v 1, don't run away to re-summon; although, having your friend put his sign near where you're fighting might be an acceptable middle-ground, as it still allows you to co-op and it is not cowardice. * If the invader runs to hide behind enemy mobs, pop a Seed of Giants and then rush to continue fighting him, instead of hiding where it's safe (such as by the bonfire). Popping a Seed in response to his action is probably more honorable than popping it the moment you get invaded just as a ""precaution"". * FIGHT PROPERLY. Don't R1 spam him down, don't parry-spam him, don't rush him in a straight line, DON'T TURTLE. Honor the invader with your best work; engage him with ruthless, calculating plays that make you stand out from the rest with your skill alone. Flank him on both sides, set him up for a team stunlock, punish any of his plays you see that are bad. Show the invader that you two are not chumps that will lose a 2 v 1, make the invader admire you even though he was killed. Again, *bow afterward.* * If you encounter the same invader multiple times (and he's not rushing you down on sight), consider dropping him a gift! Even a stack of Green Blossoms will make any invader smile, you have no idea how quickly we burn through them! If he's one of the cool ones, he'll leave you a gift back, and now you've made a new friend. Those are just top-of-my-head ideas! I definitely believe ganking with honor is a thing though, and that both the host's team and the invaders can be allowed to enjoy Dark Souls at the same time. Just work to make invasions fun and not stressful. You're definitely right though, ""tooth-and-nail"" is what the majority of co-opers go through, invasion or not. I think a lot of ""young players"" that invade miss the point, and the onlookers who watch YT videos of ""invaders owning gankers"" and have no clue what all the social newaunces mean, even moreso. Don't give up, you two! I promise you your plight is understood and that the one who sent you that angry message was one of the ""young'uns"", and he's going to either learn his lesson himself or move on to another game, where he is hopefully more welcome than in ours."

Plenty of people there mock the idea of ""male privilege"" and other basic concepts of the modern left. Yet when you ask them why ""normies"" don't understand them, the usual response goes along the lines of: average men don't repel women, women don't want to admit to themselves they do this, and incels are by definition lonely and disconnected, so they don't show up on mainstream society's view of itself. In short, they are using the theory behind privilege and invisible minorities, that they claim is without merit. I've been asking myself for a while now: is it worth engaging them? I'm sure I can qualify, and I see among them my own worst traits magnified (passivity, fear of coming across wrong, complete blank at society's web of expectations and simply no interest in what passes for ordinary conversation). The odd thing is, there are still plenty of disturbingly misogynistic posts, but the most upvoted comments are the saner ones, suggesting that the place has a demographic of well-adjusted observers (which is not true of any red-pill sub). There seems to be a pattern of: extremists (Caamib, in this case) found the place, it attracts followers who are less committed, they attract more normal people trying to convert the followers. As it is, I'm unsure I can contribute anything. But I wish I could."

Harley doesn't sell the unit I [think I] need because it is now obsolete and newer bikes have the two computers combined in one unit. Would the newer units from recent sportsters be compatible with mine or do I need to pick up an old model wherever I can find it?"

1,Acid rap was an amazing album im sure that had nothing to do with his rise to fame,"Local Chicago artists and rappers I've met believe his dad was instrumental in his rise. Chicago is fucking hard as shit to make it as an artist, partly due to lack of any major label representation. Especially when you're relying on live performances to get noticed. For such a large city, Chicago has a limited number of venues. The city plays a large part in this, mainly through noise restrictions. Even smaller number of venues where rappers can perform. Now because Chance's dad worked for the mayor's office in the past, people suspect he pulled strings that got him the shows he needed to play early on. I have zero evidence of this but after living in Chicago as a performing artist and witnessing first hand how crooked that city is I don't find it hard to believe."

So the more you fidget the less of a risk there is for developing a blood clot. Its basically a mini survival instinct. When its cold, fidgeting and shivering causes you to keep warm through movement and keeping your blood circulating.

Workers there come and go but there's an old man that's been there the entire time. Once, a long time ago, he asked me if I would put songs on a mp3 player for him. I told him ~~hell~~ no and that he needed to learn to use a computer himself, to which he didn't like, but I don't care because I can take or leave the guy. The other day I was getting ready to take off and he comes up to me asking me questions (english isn't his first language and like I said, I can take or leave the guy so I just wanted him to go away the entire time) to which I act friendly enough. He starts feeling my arm, saying I must have big muscles, then he starts trying to pull me in for a kiss. I was at work so I couldn't strangle his stupid ass like I would've liked, but I made it clear he's dead to me. This isn't the first time this has happened. Some men just come to the conclusion that I'd have anything to do with them just because I'm polite. And it's not always old men either, guys have beckoned me over for whatever reason and then have leaned in for a kiss *as* I'm telling them I want nothing to do with them. I should just tell them the truth, I'd never consider dating an old man. I think old men are disgusting. They should stick with women their own age. Young women who are into old men have issues or they want their money when they die. Old, broke-ass men that chase after young women are fucking pathetic. No guy, I don't want to get to know you, I don't even want to expend the energy it would take to remember your name. I'd rather go back to before I was burdened with your existence, I miss that, please let me relive that time once again. I swear to all that's holy, I take the time to make myself look as ratchet as possible and I *still* can't get men to leave me alone. I could cover myself with literal feces and will still get hit on by at least one fucking homeless guy. What do I have to do?!? I don't want to assume every man is like that because it's not true. But when I have to look at the ground everywhere I go because merely making eye contact for even one second is enough to get me followed around an entire grocery store (and I see you, motherfucker, you think you're slick but you're as plain as day, do you think I'm stupid or blind?!) what choice do I have but to put up my defenses? I need a really big fucking dog to take around with me or something..."

0,"Dropping a Concussion to swing a 1v1 in your favor or to disengage is something that had not crossed my mind, excellent point.","There are so many good uses for concussion blast. Good for quick direction changes midair to avoid enemy fire. Getting out of range of ults. Boosting back to the fight after a respawn. Others have mentioned separating Reinhardt from his team. Also nudging his charges off-course, and sending him out of melee range after he ults. I like to use it to push enemies away from my teammates caught in a zarya ult too. Most of all, though, it's useful to disrupt your opponent in 1 on 1 duels. Making McCree miss even one shot can be the difference between life and death. And the forced movement can make it easier to land that one rocket on a slippery tracer. It's easy to write it off as a low-impact move but used strategically, it's anything but.

1,But the stats say our defense is top 10,"Living in the past, again, forever into the future I posted this in the offseason, looks like it's playing out perfectly again. Last year I was so hyped, and we all felt the same for good reason. Team had played well before...if Randall and DMC could be ok, and if our defense could be just as good as it was (not very good) then there was no reason to think we wouldn't be a pretty damn good team with a nice shot to do well in the playoffs! I remember posting on here, that NOTHING matters if Romo goes down. Well low and behold, Romo goes down and our team falls apart and we have the worst season in recent memory. Our defense was about as crappy as we felt it would be, our running game was pretty damn good as we hoped it would be. So w hy did we suck so hard? We can't close out teams, and even in 2014, we haven't been able to close out a team with our defense for damn near as long as I can remember. In 2014, Romo got us leads and Demarco closed them out. And if that didn't happen, we could always count on Romo to bring us back and give us a chance for that FG or game winning TD IF we got the last possesion. Please note that's our offense: getting us leads closing out games and/or bringing us back from the brink. Our defense rarely ever makes game changing plays when we need them. Because this teams defense SUCKS DICKS at closing out games when we have a lead. I had a feeling that every time we are up by less than 8, and the opponent gets the ball in a situation where they will have the last possession, we're done. We cant' get any pressure on the QB, and in no huddle 2 minute drill it's just way to much pressure on our extremely below average defense to hold onto that lead. We saw it last year in OT 2 times. Neither time did the offense even get on the field and we lost. Reddit and PFF to the rescue here is the data since 2011 in the scenario where the Cowboys are either tied or ahead by less than 8 with 4 minutes to go in the 4th quarter. Dallas has allowed the most TDs in that time with 12. The Vikings have allowed the most total scoring plays with 21 Dallas has lost more games than any other team in the league in this scenario with 15 losses since 2011. That's out of 31 opportunities, which is 48.39% of the time. That's almost a full season worth of losses because our defense can't stop the opponent when it matters most. and in that time, Dallas has the worst percentage of all NFL teams. So with all that being said, looking at our current roster, what reasons do I have to believe our defense is better now at getting press ure and sealing wins. With Romo, there are games we'll win even though the defense gives up points at the end of games as long as there is SOME time left for him to use his magic. But if he goes down, and he probably will at some point, we're doomed. I do believe if we have Romo, and Elliot playing well that we can close out games using our offense, but that's such a damn risky proposition. Because your a one trick pony at that point, and if that pony gets hurt in any significant way, again, we're doomed. ..discuss"

Obama and most Dems wanted a public option, whereas the Senate bill drafted by Max Baucus and his former insurance exec staffers was designed to be a fig leaf that would leave insurers free to kill reform and replace it with something that would give them the subsidies without the regulations. Of course, all of it could have been avoided if Dems had bothered to actually campaign for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat."

0,It's just a bullshit done by conservative to downplay any culture that is against Conservative's view(aka Islam).,"""Budaya Ketimuran"" I bet most peoples here are already familiar with this term. And i have to admit, back then i actually buy and believe this idea that Eastern culture is promoting all sort of ""good"" morality value (ex: polite clothing, family value, religion, etc). But as time goes, i realize how questionable it really is. Eastern culture are very different from one another. There is the more ""conservative"" Middle Eastern culture, the more ""liberal"" country such as Japan and South Korea, the strict government controlled country such as China and of course there is ""Best"" Korea. Basically, it's a very wide spectrum and contain a lot of value that contradict one another. Perhaps the only value that i can agree to be still totally applied to all or at least most of them is the family value. In my opinion, the current Indonesia tries too hard to be on the conservative spectrum of the Eastern culture, while some of it's citizen openly (or secretly) want to be on the more liberal spectrum of lifestyle/culture. I know it might be a bit of an over-simplification, but what do you guys think?"

One of the major flaws of the flintlock design is that you have to rely on there being powder outside of the weapon, and you have to rely on the frizzen to keep it in place. A problem with this a lot of people discovered the hard way is that after a vigorous activity like climbing a tree, riding a horse, or clubbing someone with the gun the frizzen can swing open. Even if it barely opens up the powder inside the pan can spill out. So if you have it completely loaded, ready to go, and you swing it, the frizzen could open up, and spill your powder leaving the gun unable to fire."

So far I've settled on the Lulzbot TAZ 5 and the Printrbot Plus as a backup, but I was informed that the printer must have an enclosed build area and filter to comply with health standards. Now, I understand how easy it is to build such an enclosure, and we're certainly capable of doing it. But, in case we're for some reason not allowed to do that, I need a backup printer. A final note, I'd like a printer that's open source (or at the very least, DRM free).

He is asked again and he rattles off more facts. Then the next guy is called in and he walks through the door and as soon as he sees the interviewer he drops to his knees and says ""Oh Lord Jesus."" Cook has to be riffing off of that story."

I've had some stuff happen to me recently, I'm feeling very lonely at the moment, so I'm looking to make some new friends who I can relate to. I'm posting here about it because gaming is my biggest hobby and one of my passions, and honestly it's a great way to meet people! So heres a little bit of information about me; I'm a 24 year old trans-female Canadian. I'm into all sorts of games, I'm dabbling in WoW again lately, and I love Overwatch, I'm on PC. I play a lot of League of Legends too, with a few IRL friends. I'm not a very competitive gamer when it comes to PvP, but I love a challenging games. I am obsessed with Dark Souls and a little game called Furi that came out a little while ago. I'm not so big into RTS games or those open world survival games, but I'm willing to give anything a shot. I have all the modern consoles, and I own a mid-range PC, so I'm willing to meet you on whatever you have. My schedule is a little crazy right now with work and school, but If you're looking for a laid back new friend, or you feel kinda like I do, send me a message and lets play some games. Or we could just talk. I'm really down for whatever right now. Battletag: Grumpasaurus#11186 Steam ID: HatesToParty Gamertag: GrumpySkelly PSN: Webzys Nintendo FC: ....pls god no."

You can 'win' in terms of mana and tempo if you have a good follow up but Ooze only really fits into control decks and in control vs control it often doesn't do as much as people think it does even when it destroys a weapon, Atiesh or otherwise.

I went on Paltalk (if any of you remember what that is, it's a voice-chat-room client) and started arguments against Christians and the sort after watching Ahmad Deedat and the works. Then one day an atheist (who's name passes me) asked a simple question: **Here's the argument:** When the devil disobeyed god, god damned him. Damning, meaning the devil will never be allowed into heaven. Then how the hell did the devil sneak back into heaven to trick Adam and Eve? Was God unaware? Was he too weak to guard his borders? What kind of God can't back his own word? This is where I started to logically question all the things I was told, the stories always fell apart when you applied logic. Now, I'm not sure if that particular story has an actual answer or if it is solid. Was the devil waiting for his damnation to be processed by bureaucratic angels? Who knows? But it set something off in me, and I thank those people for making good logical arguments (even though they were pretty snobby and rude about it). It was worth it in the end."

There are cool hanging lights, kind of like the ones at DMM Planets in Japan (though nowhere near as good). While we were in that part of the ride, my dad leaned over and told me completely out of the blue that ""The church has never said anything about what happened to most of the 12 tribes of Israel, but space travel is a possible explanation."" It took a lot of effort not to laugh my ass off right there. After we got off the ride, I told him, ""I'm not trying to be mean, but that sounds like a giant load of BS.""

Despite firing most of my bullets with my crosshair on top of him, no hit markers even when I surely saw my crosshair on his head at one shot. Happened again later, this one was the most unbelievable. A guy I was right behind not even a few feet away. Shot him in the back with a shotgun, no hit marker. While my character pumped the shotgun he turned around, and I shot him again, this time even closer and with my crosshair on his chest. No hit marker again. Then he headshots me with an AR before I could shoot again. And finally just now, when I had a medium range encounter with my AK. I held down the trigger and actually did a surprisingly good job of keeping the crosshair on him, because I'm usually pretty bad with the AK. I was proud of myself until I realized I didn't get any hit markers until the last 2-3 bullets but it was too late and I he killed me? I fired over half a clip.. Not sure what to say. I don't recall having this problem in the old H1."

Of course, I am opposed to voting for neoconservatives and social liberals. But this election I'm not voting because there isn't anyone good. Trump, Clinton, Johnson, and Stein aren't libertarians, so I couldn't justify voting for any of them.

Since growing up with the first 3 generations of Pokemon games I eventually grew out of it a bit. However I revisited the series when Black and White was released and have since purchased every entry. I feel that the series has become way too easy, I know what you're thinking the series is aimed at children but does that mean we shouldn't have a difficulty setting to appeal to an older audience? I feel that there was at least some degree of difficulty in the older games but now they're a joke. Maybe I'm just a overall a better gamer but short of the free legendaries, dumb AI, and being given EXP share at the beginning of the game (which applies to all of your Pokemon) I feel like the series could benefit from a increased difficulty mechanic. This could make trainers more combat aggressive, carry more Pokemon for you to battle against and even removing the option to switch out of battle without missing a turn would be a great start. I'd certainly play a game like that, what do you think?"

1,Seize him guys!,"I love Pebble, but I'm moving to Apple Watch I've worn both the OG and PTR for a combined two years. I fell in love with both of them and soon found myself panicking if I left my watch at home. They helped me drastically reduce the number of times I pulled out my phone and completely erased my ""what if they responded"" anxiety. So when I bought an Apple Watch during a very impulsive binge shopping spree, I figured I'd just try it out and return it. Figured the complaints about the battery life and slowness would immediately turn me off. Well, I was wrong. I fell in love with it, hard. The number of very useful apps for things I already used on my phone was amazing, and I found the health features to be more helpful for me. I'm not saying the Apple Watch is objectively better than Pebble. It's going to come down to personal preference. If you want something basic that stays out of the way and keeps things simple, Pebble is fantastic for that. For me, I appreciate the interaction options with Apple notifications and being able to quickly give input to certain apps. And I've made use of Siri and receiving calls directly on the Watch far more than I thought I would. So Pebble, it's been fun, and I may eventually be back. For now, though, I'm jumping ship. On a side note, I will be selling my silver/white PTR (smaller size). There is a slight scuff on the screen (just looks like a tiny smudge) but otherwise clean. I have both the red leather band (looks worn) and the silver mesh Pebble band. So if anyone is interested, feel free to message me!"
